## Introduction for New Players
"The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad" is a two-player, competitive TTRPG that channels the cynical, subversive energy of post-modern superhero stories such as *The Boys*. It zeroes in on a sharp theme: the powerless fighting the super‑powerful. One player takes on the role of **The Necessary Eagle**, a publicly adored "beacon of truth, justice and the American way" who is, in reality, a dangerous sociopath. The other player is **The Good Cad**, an ordinary person turned vigilante after their life was destroyed as collateral damage from one of the Eagle's "heroic" acts.

The game uses a standard deck of cards to represent this asymmetric conflict. The Necessary Eagle is all‑powerful, drawing cards from the deck to face societal Conflicts and countering them with high cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack) that reflect their four suits of superpowers. But every choice has consequences: using these powers generates harm (bystanders getting hurt) and Bad Press, perfectly reflecting a PR‑obsessed, collateral‑damage‑heavy world where the public perception is everything.

The Good Cad on the other hand operates in the shadows, unable to confront the hero directly. Their entire plan is to exploit the Eagle's arrogance and messes. The Cad scavenges cards the Eagle discards—picking through the wreckage of the hero's actions to find resources, intel, and weapons. They use these to build Schemes and leverage the Eagle's Bad Press until they can force a Showdown, creating the perfect moment to expose the "hero" for the monster they truly are. This creates a parasitic dynamic: the Cad needs the Eagle to succeed, creating the collateral damage they thrive on. But if the Necessary Eagle actually fails to overcome their conflicts, everyone loses as things truly get bad without a hero. It's a rare two‑player PvP system that captures the cat‑and‑mouse, brains‑vs‑PR dynamic of its inspirations.

The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad sits in a fascinating niche within the TTRPG world. Two‑player‑specific, directly competitive (PvP) RPGs are rare. This one uses a standard deck of cards not just for resolution, but as the core representation of powers, resources, conflicts, and even narrative beats. Thematically, it's a sharp deconstruction of the superhero genre, focusing on collateral damage, public perception, and the grim reality behind the cape.

### What is "The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad"?

It's a two‑player, competitive (PvP), card‑based tabletop role‑playing game using a standard 52‑card deck. One player takes the role of The Necessary Eagle, a powerful but deeply flawed superhero. The other plays The Good Cad, an ordinary person turned antagonist, seeking revenge after the Eagle destroyed their life. The game explores themes of power, consequence, public image, and vengeance in a deconstructed superhero setting.

### How Do You Play? — The Asymmetrical Roles

The game is fundamentally asymmetrical, meaning each player has different goals, abilities, resources, and turn structures.

**Playing The Necessary Eagle:**

* **Goal:** Survive until the deck runs out without triggering your lose conditions.
* **Setup:**
    * You embody the public‑facing ideal superhero.
    * You have four superpowers tied to suits (e.g., Hearts: Invulnerability, Spades: Super Strength, Diamonds: Energy Blasts, Clubs: Super Movement). The specific suits might vary per game.
    * You start with a powerful hand: one Ace (your strongest power), one King, and two Queens of different suits.
    * Choose a suitably heroic name. You always go first.
* **Gameplay Loop:**
    1.  **Draw:** Fill your hand to five cards.
    2.  **Reveal Conflicts:** Draw two cards face‑up; these are the crises you must deal with this turn. The Cad describes these based on their value and suit.
        * Value determines Conflict Type (e.g., 2 = Robbery, 8 = Disaster, K = Alien Threat, A = Super Villain, Joker = Internal Conflict).
        * Suit determines Conflict Field (e.g., Hearts = Political, Spades = Business, Diamonds = Criminal, Clubs = Ideological).
    3.  **Counter Conflicts:** Play cards (your superpowers) from your hand against the conflict cards. Narrate how you use your powers. An Ace played represents relying on humanity, not powers.
    4.  **Resolution:** A conflict is countered if the total value of cards played against it exceeds the conflict card's value. Place countered conflict cards and the cards used to counter them aside for the Cad to potentially scavenge. Leave uncountered conflicts and the cards played against them on the table.
    5.  **Gain Tokens:** Gain Popular Support if you countered both conflicts using only cards of the same suit as each conflict. Gain Bad Press if you countered using only cards of the opposite color or if you failed to counter both conflicts.
    6.  **Cause Harm:** If you used a Jack, Queen, King, or Ace to counter a conflict, you caused collateral damage affecting the Cad. Describe the harm; the Cad explains who the victim was to them.
    7.  **Check Lose Condition:** If two uncountered conflicts remain, you lose immediately.
    8.  **Pass Turn.**
* **Tokens:**
    * Spend Popular Support to discard a card and draw a new one. Spending a token also triggers a brief, non‑combat scene between you and the Cad.
    * Bad Press tokens are collected and can be used by the Cad against you.

**Playing The Good Cad:**

* **Goal:** Win two Showdowns against the Eagle.
* **Setup:**
    * You are an ordinary person whose life was ruined by the Eagle. Define what you lost (spouse, job, dignity, etc.) and keep it visible.
    * Choose a primary resource tied to a suit (Hearts: People, Spades: Weapons/Tools, Diamonds: Intel, Clubs: Determination/Skills).
    * You start with only the 2 of your chosen suit in hand.
    * Choose a real name and a codename. You go second.
* **Gameplay Loop:**
    1.  **Scavenge:** Look at the cards the Eagle set aside (countered conflicts + cards used). Choose one. If its value is less than or equal to the value of a card in your hand + 1, add it to your hand. Otherwise, add it to your face‑up Support Pile. You cannot pick up Jokers. Describe what resource or information you salvaged. Cards the Eagle used to cause Harm go directly to your Support Pile.
    2.  **Draw Scheme:** Draw one card face‑up. This is a future Scheme against the Eagle. Describe it; the Eagle points out a flaw.
    3.  **Complete Scheme (Optional):** Play cards from your hand or Support Pile to match or exceed a face‑up Scheme's value. Cards matching the Scheme's suit count as +1 value. Jokers have a value of 1 for scheming. If successful, take the Scheme card into your hand. You can complete multiple Schemes.
    4.  **Showdown (Optional):** Initiate a direct confrontation.
        * The Eagle fills their hand to three cards.
        * You play any number of cards (you must keep at least one in hand). Narrate your attack based on suits and values. Aces represent hitting them emotionally.
        * The Eagle must play cards to beat your total value. Your Aces require two cards to counter, regardless of value.
        * You win the Showdown if the Eagle cannot beat your total. This is your path to victory.
    5.  **Pass Turn.**
* **Playing Cards:** Cards from hand have their printed value (A = 14, Joker = any 1–15). Cards from the Support Pile have a value of 1. You can never play your last card from hand. Narrate how your resources (suits) are used.
* **Using Bad Press:** Spend a Bad Press token collected by the Eagle to return a card you played from your hand back to your hand instead of discarding it (cannot be used on Jokers). Ask the Eagle why their bad press lets you get away with this.
* **Intervening (Eagle's Turn):** You can optionally play cards during the Eagle's turn to increase a Conflict's value or help the Eagle counter it, narrating your interference. These cards become available for scavenging. You must keep one card in hand.

### Why Play This Game?

* **Unique two‑player PvP:** Focused, competitive role‑playing experience that’s rare in the hobby.
* **Superhero deconstruction:** Explores the dark side of superpowers and the cost of "heroism."
* **Asymmetrical gameplay:** Distinct experiences and strategies for each player (overwhelming power vs. cunning resource management).
* **Narrative card mechanics:** Uses the familiar deck of cards in evocative ways to drive story and character actions.
* **Moral ambiguity:** Blurs the lines between hero and villain, forcing players to confront uncomfortable truths about their characters.
