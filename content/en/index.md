### Fully completed and free products

- **Cars & Family** &mdash; this high-octane one-page RPG puts you in the driver's seat as *Fast & Furious*-style international thieves. With your leader Von Petrol out of commission, you must balance your incredible street racing skills (Cars) with the bonds of your crew (Family) to pull off daring heists. Built on the *Lasers & Feelings* system, it is a perfect lightweight game for explosive action. Available in both English and Finnish.

  - [itch.io: Cars & Family (en) / Autot & Perhe (fi)](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/cars-and-family)
  - [roolipelikirjasto: Autot ja Perhe / Cars and Family](https://roolipelikirjasto.fi/series/stored/7)
  - [Carros & Família](/downloads/carros-and-familia.pdf) &mdash; Portuguese translation of Cars & Family, translated and enhanced by Vila Nova.
- **Pros & Cons** drops you into a high-stakes heist movie like *Ocean's Eleven* or *Leverage*. A clever hack of *Lasers & Feelings*, it replaces dice with a standard deck of cards. Your character is defined by a single card (2-9) that balances being a **Pro** (professional) vs a **Con** (criminal improvisation). Face cards trigger narrative Twists, and Flashbacks let you rewrite your failures.

  - [コンズ & プロズ](https://twitter.com/feltk/status/1376309603734937600) &mdash; Japanese translation of Pros & Cons, translated by [@feltk](https://twitter.com/feltk).
- **Cyberpunk is Dead** &mdash; this *Forged in the Dark* game flips the script on the cyberpunk genre: you aren't rebellious heroes fighting the corps—you are their disposable, underpaid hit squad, enforcing petty interests against often sympathetic targets. It masterfully subverts its *Blades in the Dark* inspiration by replacing playbooks with numbered, interchangeable "Operatives" and utilizing a unique 3d12 system where success often comes with "Overreaction," and survival means a debt-inducing death spiral of mandatory cyberware. It's a bleakly fascinating critique of cyberpunk tropes through elegantly minimalist, pressure-cooker mechanics.

  - [roolipelikirjasto: Cyberpunk is Dead](https://roolipelikirjasto.fi/book/148)
- **The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad** &mdash; a competitive 2-player card game about the asymmetrical war between a sociopathic superhero and the vengeful mortal they wronged. Channeling the cynical energy of *The Boys*, one player wields godlike powers and manages PR fallout, while the other scavenges through the collateral damage to build the perfect weapon to kill them.

  - [itch.io: The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/the-necessary-eagle-vs-the-good-cad)
- **Bike on Fire** &mdash; a two-player, card based competitive RPG of tragic hobby obsession. Available in English and Finnish.
  - [Bike on Fire (en) / Palava pyörä (fi)](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/bike-on-fire) 
- **Vuosisata.** is a post-cataclysm RPG where history meets magic (1912-2012), powered entirely by a Tarot deck. Succeed by creatively interpreting the meaning of cards played from your hand, but beware, matching cards trigger deadly Catastrophes.

- **We can't stop here...** &mdash; a grimy, psychedelic *Mörk Borg* supplement about a road trip that never ends. You travel with a sentient, decaying wagon, consuming its dangerous herbs to keep it moving. Features a risk/reward addiction system and a unique "Trip Encounter Table" where horrors only become real if the hallucination is shared. Includes the introductory adventure *"...this is BAT country"*.

### Projects in various stage of completion

- **Night of the Thirteenth** &mdash; a slasher-horror RPG where you play the cast of a movie that hasn't happened yet. Powered by a unique "d13" (d10+d4) system and a standard deck of cards for generating threats, it simulates the high lethality of 80s slashers. Every roll risks "Fallout" &mdash; consequences that range from making noise to leading the killer right to you, pushing you one step closer to your third and final Strike. 
  - [Read more about Night of the Thirteenth](/en/nott)
  - [itch.io: Night of the Thirteenth](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/night-of-the-thirteenth)
- **Them Deeper Bones** &mdash; a post-post-apocalyptic retro adventure game / OSR style RPG where you explore a world generations after a magical cataclysm reshaped history. As part of a rare, officially sanctioned "Rediscovery Company", you venture beyond the borders of the known world to uncover lost treasures, forgotten lore, and the truth. Explicitly rejecting the colonialist Frontier Myth, Them Deeper Bones draws inspiration from Finnish folklore, presenting a wilderness full of ancient magic to be respected and ruins that whisper tales of your own ancestors.

  - [Read more about the Black Shield Canton](/en/mustan-kilven-kantoni)
  - [itch.io: Them Deeper Bones](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/them-deeper-bones)
- **+H** &mdash; a Finnish language modern-day science horror roleplaying game where players portray highly competent experts on a field team for the private biotech giant, New Horizons. The game focuses on the team's first true contact with the "shadow biosphere" &mdash; a newly active, non-carbon-based "second life" on Earth. Its excellent, mission-based system is built on *Powered by the Apocalypse* (*PbtA*) mechanics but is heavily modified, drawing innovations from story games, the Nordic immersion tradition, and a desire to modernize the investigative horror of *Call of Cthulhu*.

- **The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.** &mdash; a prototype combat system designed to shift the focus from a character sheet to player skill, tactical planning, and precise timing. 
  - [Read more about The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.](/en/the-pig-is-sus)
  - [itch.io: The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/the-pig-is-sus)
- **A Particular Group of Corvids** &mdash; casts you as hardboiled bird detectives in the free-thinking city of Roost, pushing back against the encroaching authoritarianism of The Sus (fascist pigs) by solving crimes and throwing punches. Inspired by gritty action-mysteries like RDJ's *Sherlock Holmes* or *Peaky Blinders* (with birds!), its elegance shines through a simple d20 core mechanic.
