## Introduction for New Players

"Night of the Thirteenth" is a horror role-playing game designed by Petri Leinonen that casts one player as the Director and the others as the "cast of a horror movie that hasn't happened yet". The game's themes are drawn directly from classic slasher films, focusing entirely on survival rather than heroism. Players take on familiar archetypes like "The Jock," "The Babysitter," or "The Genre Savant" and are thrown into a high-lethality scenario where "most of you won't make it". The core experience is about managing the escalating dread of being hunted by an unstoppable killer in iconic settings like a cabin in the woods or a house party in the suburbs.

The game's excellence is driven by its elegant and thematic mechanics, which use a standard deck of cards and a unique "d13" dice roll (a d10 + a d4). The Director uses a "Threat Deck" of cards to reveal upcoming challenges; the suit determines the nature of the test (e.g., Spades for Power, Hearts for Resolve), and the number sets the difficulty. The most innovative part is the "Fallout die" (the d4), which determines the consequences of every roll, success or fail. A low roll might be a 'clean' success, but a high roll can be 'costly' or 'dire,' meaning even when you succeed, you might lose an item, give away your location, or (if facing the Killer) even gain a Strike.

Survival is a desperate race against a ticking clock. The Killer is represented by face cards, and confrontations are incredibly dangerous; failure always earns you a Strike. Characters are eliminated in a "genre-fitting, gruesome fashion" after receiving their third Strike. To "win," the players must discover the killer's weakness by successfully defeating a face card of all four suits. This triggers the "Endgame," a bloody climax where the deck is stripped down to only face cards and Jokers, leading to a final, desperate test to see if anyone survives to see the dawn.

## Questions about Night of the Thirteenth

### What is *Night of the Thirteenth*?

*Night of the Thirteenth* is a horror role-playing game designed by Petri Leinonen. Players take on the roles of characters in a horror movie setting who are being hunted by an "unstoppable killer".

### What is the goal of the game?

The goal for the players is not to defeat the killer like heroes, but simply to survive until sunrise. The game is designed to be difficult; players are expected to win only about one-third of the time.

### What roles do players have?

The game requires 4 players and one "Director".

* **The Director:** This person plays the killer, describes the world, and sets the challenges that the players face.
* **The Players:** The 4 players each create a character who is "most likely doomed".

### What do you need to play?

To play the game, you will need the following components:
* A standard playing card deck with two distinct Jokers.
* At least one pair of a d4 and a d10.
* 13 tokens to be used as Genre Points.
* Pen and paper for all participants.

### How do you set up the game?

The game setup follows four main steps:
1.  Choose the playset you will use.
2.  The Director builds the card decks.
3.  The players create their characters.
4.  Begin the game.

**Deck Setup:**
The Director prepares three sets of cards:
* **The Threat Deck:** This deck starts with all 2s, 3s, 4s, and one Jack, shuffled together. The four Aces are then placed face-up on top of this deck.
* **The Reserves:** The rest of the cards are set aside in five piles: the Number Reserve (5s through 10s), separate piles for the remaining Jacks, Queens, and Kings, and the two Jokers.
* **The Trophy Pile:** The Director takes a random 10 from the Number Reserve to start this face-up pile. The top card of this pile sets the Base Difficulty for any Test made against the Killer.

### How does the "d13" dice system work?

The game uses a "d13" dice roll, which is created by rolling a d10 and a d4 and adding them together.
* The **d10 (Main die)** is read from 0 to 9.
* The **d4 (Fallout die)** is read from 1 to 4.
This results in a total roll between 1 and 13.

### How do you perform a Test?

When a player tries something risky to overcome a challenge, they must make a Test.

**1. Determine the Challenge and Difficulty**
The challenge is determined by the face-up Threat Card on top of the Threat Deck.
* **Suit:** The card's suit sets the nature of the challenge:
    * : Power (physical)
    * : Resolve (nerves)
    * : Intellect (knowhow)
    * : Finesse (precise)
* **Number Card Difficulty:** If the card is a number card, its number is the difficulty you must roll against.
* **Face Card Difficulty (The Killer):** If the card is a Jack, Queen, or King, you are confronting the Killer. The difficulty is the value of the top card of the Trophy Pile plus a modifier:
    * **Jack:** +1
    * **Queen:** +2
    * **King:** +3

**2. Roll the Dice**
The player rolls the d13 (d10+d4).
* **Success:** If the roll is equal to or greater than the difficulty.
* **Failure:** If the roll is less than the difficulty.

**3. Determine the Fallout**
The number rolled on the d4 is the "Fallout," which determines the consequences. A higher roll is worse.
* **Success Fallout:**
    * **1 (Clean):** Perfect execution.
    * **2 (Messy):** You succeed but make noise or a mess.
    * **3 (Costly):** You succeed but lose an item or give away your general location.
    * **4 (Dire):** You barely succeed, and the Killer knows exactly where you are.
* **Failure Fallout:**
    * **1 (Clean):** You fail, but with no extra hassle.
    * **2 (Messy):** You fail, and it's not clean.
    * **3 (Costly):** You fail and lose something or hurt yourself.
    * **4 (Dire):** You fail and gain one Strike.

### How are Tests resolved?

What happens next depends on the card type and whether you succeeded or failed.

* **Number Card Success:** The Threat Card is moved to the top of the Trophy Pile. The Director adds the next card from the Number Reserve to the *bottom* of the Threat Deck.
* **Number Card Failure:** The Threat Card is placed on the *bottom* of the Threat Deck. The Director also adds the next card from the Number Reserve to the bottom of the deck. If the failure had Dire (4) Fallout, you gain one Strike.
* **Face Card Success (vs. Killer):** Another face card is added to the Threat Deck from the reserves (a Jack for 1-2 Fallout, a Queen for 3-4 Fallout). If this was the first time a card of that *suit* was defeated, it is removed from the game.
* **Face Card Failure (vs. Killer):** The player gains one Strike, and a random King is added to the bottom of the Threat Deck.
* **After *any* Killer confrontation (Face Card):** The entire Threat Deck and Trophy Pile are shuffled.

### How can players influence rolls?

Players can use two mechanics to influence their dice rolls:
* **Aptitude:** When creating a character, you select an Aptitude (Power, Resolve, Intellect, or Finesse). If you make a Test where the Threat Card's suit matches your Aptitude, you can add or subtract one from the Fallout die (d4) result *after* the roll.
* **Genre Points:** The Director has 13 Genre Points to award to players for "playing into the genre's tropes". A player can spend one Genre Point to reroll their entire d13 and add a +1 to the main die (d10). The second result must be accepted.

### What are "Strikes" and how do you get them?

Strikes are "close calls with death". If a character gets their third Strike, their story is over, and they are out of the game.
You gain one Strike when you:
* Fail any Test against the Killer (a face card).
* Fail any Test with a Dire (4) Fallout.
* Succeed in a Test against the Killer with a Dire (4) Fallout.
A character can only gain one Strike from any single Test.

### How do you win the game (or trigger the Endgame)?

The "Endgame" is triggered when the players successfully defeat a face card from all four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs).

When this happens, the Director removes all number cards from the Threat Deck and shuffles both Jokers into the remaining deck of face cards.

* **The Black Joker (The Twist):** This card triggers a Test. The difficulty is set by the top card of the *shuffled* Trophy Pile. Success removes the highest face card from the deck; failure adds another King. The Black Joker is then removed from the game.
* **The Red Joker (The End):** This card triggers the final Test. The difficulty is again set by the top card of the shuffled Trophy Pile.
    * **Success:** Any surviving characters have won and see the dawn.
    * **Failure:** The character making the Test is killed. The Red Joker is shuffled back into the deck, and the game continues for any remaining survivors.
