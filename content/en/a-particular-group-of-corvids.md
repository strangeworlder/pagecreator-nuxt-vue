## Introduction for New Players
Step into the rain-slicked streets of Roost as "A Particular Group of Corvids," a mystery and action RPG by Petri Leinonen where you play as skilled, two-fisted bird sleuths. Roost is a haven for artists and individualists, a stark contrast to the world outside increasingly dominated by the authoritarian porcine regime known only as The Sus. As corvids—a temporary calling for capable members of the community —your job is to act as the city's unofficial watchdogs, solving crimes and dealing with troublemakers swiftly and effectively, preventing The Sus from gaining a foothold by intervening themselves. The tone aims for a blend of sharp investigation and tough action, evoking Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes movies mixed with some Peaky Blinders.

Even in its draft stage, the game showcases an elegantly simple core system built for narrative flexibility. When attempting something risky, you assemble a pool of d20s, adding dice if the action aligns with your expertise, your chosen Bird Type (like Crow or Magpie), your elemental focus (like Flame or Stone), if the situation is dramatic, or if you have an advantage. You roll the pool and take the single highest die; a 10 or more is a success, with higher results offering greater degrees of success. This core resolution is beautifully augmented by player agency: you can choose to accept a narrative "Cost"—like taking a hit, losing gear, or gaining "Feathers"—to bump a lower result up the success ladder. Additionally, you can spend "Conviction," representing your willingness to fight, to reroll a single die.

The game's unique potential crystallizes in its currency systems, particularly "Feathers." Gained often through using powerful bird abilities or taking Costs, Feathers represent the struggle against your character's base corvid instincts (like a Crow's need for attention or a Magpie's selfishness). Accumulate too many, and a failed d20 roll might see you lose control for a scene, acting purely on instinct. This risk is balanced against "Exhaustion," which functions like hit points, increasing when you face injustice, fail rolls, take Costs, or get hit, potentially taking you out of a fight. Together, these mechanics promise a dynamic experience blending tactical choices with compelling character arcs, focused on investigation, action, and the fight for freedom.

## What is *A particular group of corvids*?

*A particular group of corvids* is a mystery and action storytelling game. Players take on the roles of "two-fisted bird sleuths" in a setting described as "Robert Downy Jr.'s Sherlock with a bit of Peaky Blinders... but with birds".

### What is the goal of the game?

The game is set in a city called the Roost. Players are corvids whose job is to keep the "Authoritarian Porcines" (also known as The Sus) out. They accomplish this by solving crimes and "punching the bad guys" before The Sus have an excuse to come in and take over.

### How do you play? (Core Mechanic)

When a player's character performs an action where the outcome could be an "interesting failure," they roll a pool of d20 dice.

* **Determine Success:** The player picks the *largest number* from the dice they rolled.
* **Threshold:** A roll of 10 or higher is a success.

### What do the dice results mean?

The game uses a "success chain" to define the degrees of success or failure:

* **20:** Critical Success 
* **15-19:** Great Success 
* **10-14:** Marginal Success 
* **5-9:** Marginal Failure 
* **2-4:** Failure 
* **1:** Spectacular Failure 

### How do you build your dice pool?

A player builds their pool of d20s by adding one die for each of the following conditions that apply:
* 1 die if this is something the character is good at.
* 1 die if the action fits the character's bird type.
* 1 die if the action fits the character's element.
* 1 die if the action is personal or "extraordinarily dramatic".
* 1 die if the character has a clear advantage or is being helped.
* -1 die if the character has a disadvantage or is being hindered.

**What if you roll 0 dice or fewer?**
If the dice pool is 0 or less, the player rolls two d20s and must keep the *lowest* result.

### How can you change a roll's outcome?

There are two primary ways to alter a roll or its result:

1. **Take a Cost:** A player can choose to "take a cost" to move their result one step up the success chain (e.g., from a Marginal Failure to a Marginal Success).
    * A cost is a "significant price". such as taking a hit in a fight, losing a valuable piece of equipment, or insulting a friend.
    * If no one can think of a good cost, the player can take 1-3 Feathers as a substitute.
2. **Spend Conviction:** A player can spend one point of Conviction to reroll a *single die* in their pool.

### What resources ("Currencies") do you track?

Players must manage three main resources:

* **Conviction:** This represents the character's "willingness to fight".
    * **Starting/Max:** You start with 1 Conviction, and your maximum is 3.
    * **Regain:** You regain it by "connecting with the community," such as witnessing hardships or offering/enjoying hospitality.
* **Feathers:** This tracks the character being drawn away from their controlled investigator self and back toward their base corvid instincts.
    * **Gaining:** When you gain a Feather, you must roll a d20.
    * **Check:** If you roll *over* your current total number of Feathers, you are fine.
    * **Succumbing:** If you roll equal to or under (implied by "Otherwise"), you "succumb to the base instinct" of your Bird Type for the rest of the scene. Your Feathers then reset to half their value, rounded down.
* **Exhaustion:** This tracks how tired the character is.
    * **Gain 1 Exhaustion when you:**
        * Witness injustice.
        * Fail a roll.
        * Accept a cost to upgrade a success.
        * Get hit in a fight.
    * **Clear Exhaustion:**
        * Clear *one* point when you enjoy or offer hospitality or when you "strike a Sus down".
        * Clear *all* Exhaustion when you solve a mystery.

### How does combat ("Kick Ass") work?

* **Enemies:** Enemies use "health clocks". When players succeed on an attack, they tick segments on this clock:
    * **Marginal Success:** 1 tick
    * **Great Success:** 2 ticks
    * **Critical Success:** 4 ticks
    * **Players:** Players use Exhaustion to track their health.
    * When an enemy hits you, you gain Exhaustion based on their success (1 for marginal, 2 for great, 4 for critical).
    * After taking Exhaustion from a hit, you must roll a d20. If your roll is *more* than your new Exhaustion total, you stay on your feet. If not, you go down.

### How does investigation ("Solve Mysteries") work?

When inspecting a scene for clues, players roll dice as normal.
* **Failure:** Even on a failure, the player "still reveals the most important thing" they need to know.
* **Success:** Any level of success will provide "more context" to what is found.

### How do you create a character?

Follow these steps to create your bird sleuth:
1.  **Choose your Bird Type:** Select from Crow (The Muscle). Jackdaw (The Spy). Magpie (The Thief). Raven (The Leader). or Rook (The Arcanist).
2.  **Choose your Element:** This is your area of expertise. Options include Blood (The Medic). Breath (The Voice). Flame (The Keen-Eyed). Soul (The Empath). or Stone (The Font of Knowledge).
3.  **Determine Starting Stats:** Your chosen Element determines your starting Conviction, Exhaustion, and Feathers.
4.  **Select Bird Powers:** You get all Level 1 powers and choose one Level 2 power from your Bird Type's list. Bird powers can only be used once per scene.
5.  **Finalize:** Create a background for your corvid and discuss with the other players how your characters know each other.
