## What is **Night of the Thirteenth**?

**Night of the Thirteenth** is a slasher-horror TTRPG by Petri Leinonen using a unique d13 system (d10+d4) and a standard card deck to simulate a horror movie cast's likely doom.

You are there to play a character in a movie that hasn't happened yet. It assumes you know something about TTRPGs and does not walk you through everything.

## How do you set up the game?

Setting up the game is a quick process of preparing the atmosphere and the tools of your demise. Start by **selecting a Playset**, which determines the horror sub-genre and setting you will be inhabiting (e.g., *Cabin in the Woods* or *Prom Night*).

The Director then constructs the **Threat Deck** by shuffling all 2s, 3s, 4s, and one Jack together, placing the four Aces face up on top to signal the start. The **Reserves** (5s-10s, remaining Face Cards, and Jokers) are set aside for later escalation. Finally, establish the **Trophy Pile** by placing a random 10 face up; this sets the initial difficulty for the Killer. Once the players **create their characters** by choosing a name, Archetype, and Aptitude, the night begins.

## How does the d13 system work?

The game uses a specialized dice system designed to produce both a numerical result and a narrative consequence in a single roll.

*   **The Formula:** d13 = d10 (0-9) + d4 (1-4)
*   **The Dice:** d10 is the main die, d4 is the Fallout Die
*   **The Constraint:** Modifiers cannot push a die outside its natural range.
*   **Fallout Logic:** High rolls are worse. A **4** on the **Fallout Die** (d4) is "Dire" and is the primary source of Strikes.

## What is the Threat Deck?

The **Threat Deck** is the engine of the game's horror. The top card is always visible, serving as the current **Threat Card** that dictates the next challenge the players will face.

The suit of the card determines the nature of the challenge and corresponds to the varied strengths of horror movie archetypes.

| Suit | Challenge Type | Examples of Archetypes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spades (♠)** | Power (Physical) | Jock, Sheriff, The Protective |
| **Hearts (♥)** | Resolve (Nerves) | Babysitter, The Final Them, Pure |
| **Clubs (♣)** | Intellect (Knowhow) | Genre Savant, Techie, Reporter |
| **Diamonds (♦)** | Finesse (Precise) | Rebel, Slacker, Cheerleader |

The value of the card dictates Severity. **1–4** are merely atmospheric, while **5–7** represent dangerous tasks. **8–10** are difficult challenges. If a **Face Card** appears, you are no longer dealing with the environment; you are confronting the Killer.

## How do you resolve a Test?

When you attempt something risky, you make a Test by rolling your **d13**. If your total is equal to or greater than the difficulty on the Threat Card, you **Succeed**. If it is less, you **Fail**.

However, the **Fallout Die** (the d4 from your roll) determines the quality of that result. A low fallout represents a clean, professional job, while a high fallout indicates a messy, noisy, or even disastrous outcome.

| d4 | Success Fallout | Failure Fallout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Clean**: Perfect execution. | **Clean**: You fail, but that's all. |
| **2** | **Messy**: You make noise/mess. | **Messy**: Failure is ugly. |
| **3** | **Costly**: Lose item/hurt yourself. | **Costly**: Personal cost/hurt. |
| **4** | **Dire**: Killer knows location. | **Dire**: **Gain one Strike.** |

## How do you survive (or die)?

This is an **Ashcan TTRPG**, meaning it's a raw, playable prototype aimed at capturing a specific feel—specifically, the high lethality of 80s slashers. Death is tracked through a simple "Three Strikes" system.

::alert{type="warning" title="Three Strikes"}
**You get a Strike when you:**
1. Fail **any** Test against the Killer.
2. Fail a Test with Dire (4) Fallout.
3. Succeed in a Test against the Killer with Dire (4) Fallout.

**When you get your third Strike, your story is over.**
::

## What happens in the Endgame?

If you manage to defeat the Killer in all four suits (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds), the **Endgame** is triggered. All number cards are removed from the deck, leaving only the Face Cards, and the **Red Joker** and **Black Joker** are shuffled in.

The game shifts to a final series of desperate rolls. Drawing the **Black Joker** represents a final twist—a last attempt to turn the tables where success removes a Face Card. Drawing the **Red Joker** is the true finale: success means you survive to see the dawn, while failure means your character dies just moments before the credits roll.

## Quick Facts

*   **Who is the Director?** The person playing the killer, describing the world, and managing the card decks.
*   **What is a Strike?** A mechanic representing a close call with death; three strikes result in character death.
*   **What are Genre Points?** Tokens the Director awards for playing into tropes. Spend one to reroll with +1.
*   **What is the Trophy Pile?** A face-up pile where defeated cards go. Its top card sets the base difficulty for the Killer.
