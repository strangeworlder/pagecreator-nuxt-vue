## Introduction for New Players

"Pros & Cons" is a tabletop RPG designed to emulate the thrill and intricate plotting of heist films like Ocean's Eleven, Leverage, or The Italian Job. Players form a crew of specialized criminals—Driver, Hacker, Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, or Thief —already in the midst of executing a supposedly impossible robbery when unexpected trouble arises . The game focuses on balancing calculated professionalism ("Pros") against daring improvisation ("Cons") as the crew navigates unforeseen obstacles and shifting circumstances. Crew creation establishes shared strengths ("Aces up your sleeve") and a central problem facing the current heist, setting the stage for drama and action from the first scene .

The system builds upon the minimalist foundation of John Harper's Lasers & Feelings, replacing its core dice mechanic with a standard deck of playing cards. Each character is defined by a single number card (2 through 9) and its suit. The number represents your balance between two approaches: a high number makes you better at being a "Pro" (practical, logical, efficient), while a low number makes you better at running a "Con" (creative, flashy, spontaneous) . The suit denotes a specific strength: Hearts for likeability, Diamonds for quickness, Spades for toughness, and Clubs for savviness . When attempting something risky, you draw one card, plus another if the task fits your Role, and a third if targeting the mark or prize directly . You choose one drawn number card: if acting as a Pro, success is drawing equal to or lower than your number; if running a Con, success is drawing equal to or higher . The suit of the chosen card then modifies the outcome: matching your suit is a critical success/marginal failure, same color is standard success/failure, and opposite color adds a complication regardless of success .

"Pros & Cons" significantly innovates on the L&F structure through its unique card mechanics. Jokers always count as critical successes. More importantly, drawing a face card (Jack, Queen, or King) introduces a narrative "Twist" instead of resolving the action normally . These Twists focus on the Mark (Jack), the Prize (Queen), or the Crew (King), posing escalating questions to the table each time a card of that value appears, dynamically generating personal stakes and plot complications . Furthermore, the game embraces the genre's non-linear storytelling with a "Flashback" mechanic: after a check without a Twist, you can narrate how you prepared for this exact situation, allowing you to re-attempt the check using the opposite approach (Pro or Con) and treating any face cards drawn during the flashback as successes (though they still trigger Twists) . These elements combine to create a fast-paced, player-driven narrative experience true to its cinematic inspirations.

Here is a summary of the game mechanics for *Pros & Cons*, optimized for web search and answer engines.

### What is *Pros & Cons*?

*Pros & Cons* is a rules-light, one-page tabletop role-playing game designed by Petri Leinonen. It is based on the *Lasers & Feelings* TTRPG system. In the game, players are a "group of criminals working to pull off a heist that was supposed to be impossible". The game begins *in media res*, with the crew already in the middle of the job and running into trouble.

### How do you create a character?

To create your character, you make four choices:
1.  **Choose your Role:** Driver, Hacker, Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, or Thief.
2.  **Choose your Energy:** Your character's personality, such as "No-nonsense," "High-energy," or "Posh".
3.  **Choose your Card:** Pick a number from 2 to 9 and one of the four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs). This is your character's core statistic.
4.  **Choose a Name**

### How does the "Pro vs. Con" mechanic work?

Your character's "Card" (your number and suit) is the key to all mechanics.

* **Your Number (Pro vs. Con):** This determines your style.
    * A **high number** (like 7, 8, or 9) means you are better at being a **Pro**: acting practical, conservative, and efficient.
    * A **low number** (like 2, 3, or 4) means you are better at running a **Con**: being creative, extravagant, and fun.
* **Your Suit (Your Strength):** This defines your innate talent.
    * **Hearts:** You're likeable.
    * **Diamonds:** You're quick.
    * **Spades:** You're rough.
    * **Clubs:** You're savvy.

### How do you make a check?

When your character attempts something "significant and risky," you make a check by drawing cards from a standard playing deck.

* **Draw 1 card** for the attempt.
* **Draw +1 card** (for a total of two) if the task fits your **Role** (e.g., a Hacker is hacking).
* **Draw +1 card** (for a total of two, or three if it also fits your Role) if the action is aimed "directly at the mark or the prize".

---

### How do you know if you succeed?

Resolving your check is a two-step process:

**Step 1: Check the Number (Success or Failure)**
From the cards you drew, you choose *one* number card to use.
* If you were being a **Pro** (logical, efficient), you **succeed** if the card's number is **equal to or lower** than your character's number.
* If you were pulling a **Con** (flashy, spontaneous), you **succeed** if the card's number is **equal to or higher** than your character's number.

**Step 2: Check the Suit (Quality of Success/Failure)**
Next, you compare the suit of the card you chose to your character's suit to see *how well* you succeeded or failed.
* **Same Suit:** It's a **critical success** (if you succeeded) or a **marginal failure** (if you failed). The GM gives you a positive extra a "positive extra thing".
* **Same Color:** It's a **simple success** (you get what you wanted) or a **simple failure** (you just don't get it).
* **Opposite Color:** It's a **marginal success** or **total failure**, and you also suffer a **complication**.

### What are Twists? (Face Cards)

If you draw a **Face Card** (Jack, Queen, or King), it is **not counted as a success**. Instead, it triggers a "Twist" in the story.
* **Jack (J):** The twist is about the **mark** (the target).
* **Queen (Q):** The twist is about the **prize** (the score).
* **King (K):** The twist is about **our crew**.

When a twist occurs, the GM asks the table a specific question from a list. The questions become more "personal" and intense the more times that card value (J, Q, or K) has been drawn, dynamically escalating the situation. The "most dramatic answer" given by the players becomes the new truth.

### What about Jokers?

A **Joker** is always a **critical success**.

---

### What is a Flashback?

After any check that did *not* result in a twist, you can choose to have a **Flashback**.
* You narrate a scene from the past showing how you "actually prepared for this".
* This allows you to **re-attempt the check**.
* When you re-roll, you *must* use the **opposite approach** (e.g., if you failed being a Pro, you must now try it as a Con).
* During a flashback, any face cards drawn are counted as **successes**, but they still trigger their twists.

### How does the GM set up the game?

The GM (Game Master) has a few special setup rules:
* **Stack the Deck:** The GM is advised to "stack the deck" before play. This involves taking one J, Q, and K out, shuffling them into the *bottom half* of the deck, and placing the "safer" half on top. This ensures the heist doesn't immediately "end immediately" with too many twists.
* **Generate the Heist:** The GM uses tables to generate the **Mark** and the **Prize**.
* **Start the Game:** The GM asks the players four questions to frame the opening scene:
    1.  "When we start, where are we?"
    2.  "What are we here to steal to help us get to our main prize?"
    3.  "How are we disguised to protect our identities?"
    4.  "What is the unexpected obstacle we just ran into?"
