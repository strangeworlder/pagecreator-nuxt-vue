## What is **Pros & Cons?**

**Pros & Cons** is widely cited as one of the most clever and innovative hacks of the *Lasers & Feelings* system. By replacing dice with a standard deck of playing cards, it does more than just randomize result, but fundamentally changes the feel of the game to match the genre. It captures the slick, high-tension pacing of films like *Ocean's Eleven* or *Leverage*, where professional planning constantly wars with desperate improvisation.

You take on the role of a specialized criminal (from a pool of Driver, Hacker, Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, or Thief), caught in the middle of a job that’s continuously spiraling out of control. We start *in media res*: the alarm is ringing, the guards are closing in, and you have to decide *right now* if you're going to stick to the plan or wing it.

> *"The most intriguing Lasers & Feelings hack I’ve ever seen... it uses a deck of playing cards instead of dice, with additional rules for plot twists and flashbacks to emulate the feel of high stakes heist films."*

## How to Play

Forget the character sheet math; this game uses a simple deck of cards to drive the action. Your thief is defined by just one thing: their **Card** (a number from 2-9 and a Suit). This single card tells you everything about how you solve problems.

**Your Number** represents the balance between your two modes of operation. A **Pro** (High Numbers) is the consummate professional: logical, efficient, and precise. A **Con** (Low Numbers) is the wild card: creative, flashy, and spontaneous.

**Your Suit** is your edge, the thing you're naturally good at. **Hearts** are Charming and Likeable, **Diamonds** are Quick and Sharp, **Spades** are Tough and Imposing, and **Clubs** are Savvy and Street-smart.

### Making a Check

When the heat is on and you attempt something risky, you **draw cards** from the deck to build your pool. You always get **1 card** just for showing up. If your **Role** (like being a Hacker hacking a terminal) applies, you get a **second card**. If you're going straight for the throat by targeting the **Mark** or the **Prize** directly you get a **third card**.

Pick the **one card** that gives you the best shot at success (or the most interesting failure).

### Resolving the Action

Did you try to do this the smart way, or the loud way? Success depends on whether you acted as a **Pro** or ran a **Con**.

| Approach | Success Condition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Acting as a PRO** | The drawn card is **equal to or LOWER** than your number. |
| **Running a CON** | The drawn card is **equal to or HIGHER** than your number. |

Now, look at the **Suit** of that card you picked. How does it match up with yours?

| Card Suit | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Matches Yours** | **Critical Success** (or Marginal Failure). You crushed it. Take a positive extra benefit. |
| **Same Color** | **Standard Success** (or Standard Failure). You get what you wanted (or you don't). Simple as that. |
| **Opposite Color** | **Marginal Success** (or Spectacular Failure). You did it, but it's messy. You suffer a **Complication**. |

## Mechanics & Twists

### Face Cards (The Twist)

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are the engine of chaos in this game. They **do not count as successes**; instead, they trigger a narrative **Twist**. If you draw one, the plan changes immediately. A **Jack (J)** messes with the **Mark**, a **Queen (Q)** complicates the **Prize**, and a **King (K)** hits the **Crew** where it hurts.

::alert{type="warning" title="Escalating Stakes"}
When a face card is drawn, the GM asks the table a question from the Twist list. If the same rank appears again, the question gets harder, more personal, and more dangerous. Your answers become the new reality of the heist.
::

### Flashbacks

Did you fail? Or did you just *pretend* to fail to set up a trap? If a check resolves without a Twist, you can call for a **Flashback**. Narrate a scene from earlier where you prepared for this exact outcome. This lets you **re-draw** for the check, but there's a catch: you *must* use the **opposite approach** (switch from Pro to Con, or vice versa). In a Flashback, Face Cards count as **Successes**, your preparation accounts for the chaos, though they still trigger their darker questions.

### Jokers

A **Joker** is the best card in the deck. It is always a **Critical Success**.

## Creating Your Crew

Joining the crew gets you into the action in seconds. first, pick a **Role** (Driver, Hacker, Hitter, Grifter, Mastermind, or Thief). Second, give them an **Energy** (like "Posh", "No-nonsense", or "High-energy"). Third, grab your **Card** (2-9 and a Suit). Finally, give them a cool **Name**. That's it. You're ready to steal.

## For the GM: Setting the Stage

You have three jobs to make this feel like a movie. First, **Stack the Deck**: shuffle one J, Q, and K into the *bottom half* of the deck so the game doesn't explode in the first five minutes. Second, **Generate the Job** using the tables for the Mark and the Prize.

Finally, **Frame the Scene** by asking these four questions to put the players right in the middle of the action:
*   "When we start, where are we?"
*   "What are we here to steal to help us get to our main prize?"
*   "How are we disguised?"
*   "What unexpected obstacle just appeared?"
