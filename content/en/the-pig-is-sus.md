## What is **The Pig Is Sus?**

**The Pig Is Sus. Eliminate The Pig.** is a tactical RPG combat prototype designed to test your skill, not just your character sheet. It abandons static turns for a dynamic, time-based initiative system where every second counts.

You play as a "chronomagically reanimated recently deceased corpse", a disposable vessel pilot for a training simulation. Your mission is simple: eliminate a bio-mechanical horror known as **The Pig**. The world is dead, your body is borrowed, and if you fail, we'll just find another corpse.

This is a game of **Skill, Timing, and Anticipation**. You aren't rolling to see *if* you hit; you are managing resources to ensure you hit *when it matters*.

## The Core Systems

The game revolves around two unique mechanics: **Action Dice** and **The Timer**.

### Action Dice
You don't have a fixed "Move Action" or "Standard Action." Instead, every round you get **5 Action Dice**. You can spend these however you want to build your turn.
*   Want to run before the enemy catches you? Put 3 dice into **Rush** and 2 into **Move**.
*   Need to hit hard? Put all 5 dice into a single **Attack**.
*   Want to be safe? Put 1 die into **Defend** and 4 into **Cast**.

When you perform an action, you roll all the dice assigned to it and **keep the single highest result**. This means allocating more dice doesn't give you *more* actions, but a *better chance* of that action succeeding spectacularly.

### The Timer
Initiative isn't a roll; it's a countdown. The round starts at **Beat 20** and counts down to **0**.
*   **The Pig** acts on fixed Beats (e.g., it *always* charges on Beat 15).
*   **You** default to acting on Beat 1 (too slow!).
*   To act sooner, you must use the **Rush** action to place your other actions higher on the Timer.

This creates a puzzle: Do you act slowly with maximum power, risking getting hit first? Or do you spend dice to Rush, acting before The Pig but attacking with less force?

## How Combat Works

Combat happens in structured **Rounds**.

### 1. The Threat (The Pig's Pattern)
At the start of the round, the Guide announces The Pig's **Pattern**. You know *exactly* what it will do and when.
*   *"The Pig is using the **Violence Pattern**. It will Smash you on Beat 15, Move on Beat 10, and Stomp everyone on Beat 0."*

### 2. The Decision (Allocating Dice)
Knowing the future, you allocate your 5 Action Dice. You declare your plan: *"I'll put 2 dice into Rush to act on Beat 12 (before the Smash), and 3 dice into Attack to hurt it."*

### 3. Resolution (The Timer)
The Guide counts down from 20. When the count hits a Beat with an action, perfectly resolve it.

### Dealing Damage: The Grit System
Damage isn't just "HP reduction." It's dice removal.
*   **The Attacker** rolls their Damage Dice (e.g., a 1d6 weapon).
*   **The Defender** has a pool of **Grit Dice** (e.g., 3d6 rolled at the start).
*   To deal damage, the Attacker's rolls must **match or exceed** the specific numbers showing on the Defender's Grit Dice. Each match removes a Grit Die.

> *Example: The Pig has Grit Dice showing `1, 2, 5`. You attack and roll a `3` and a `6`. The `3` eliminates the `1` or `2`. The `6` eliminates the `5`. Two hits!*

If the defender runs out of Grit Dice, they are **Dying**. If an attack fails to remove any dice, the damage value is added to the defender's **Threat Dice**, making them harder to hit next time.

## Character Creation: Your Vessel

You are a reanimated corpse. You have vague memories of a past life that grant you power.

### Step 1: Choose a Role
*   **The Assassin**: Speedy and lethal. You get extra **Tricks**, move faster (6m), and can reroll 1s on Move/Rush.
*   **The Berserker**: A juggernaut. Your Grit Dice are **d8s** (tougher!), and you can reroll 1s on Attack/Defend.
*   **The Magus**: A master of spells. You start with **5 Mana Pulses** (instead of 3) and extra Incantations. You can reroll 1s on Cast/Rest.

### Step 2: Determine Abilities
Roll on the tables to see what your vessel remembers:
*   **Tricks** (1d8): Martial maneuvers like *Trip*, *Disarm*, or *Hamstring*.
*   **Elemental Bolt** (1d4): The type of damage your basic magic deals (*Cold, Darkness, Fire, Wind*).
*   **Incantations** (1d4): Utility spells like *Minor Healing* or *Misty Form*.

## For the Guide: The Sus

**The Sus** (genus of fascist monstrosities) are the enemy. They represent a "Singular Mega Porcine Threat Event." For this training scenario, players face **The Piglet**, a nerfed version of the real biomechanical horrors waiting outside.

### The Piglet Stats
*   **Grit Dice:** 4d8 + 2d8 per character.
*   **Defense Value (DV):** 15 (Players must roll >15 to trigger special effects/crits).

### Patterns of Action
The Pig follows a strict script. Choose one each round.

| Pattern | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Assessment** | **15:** Smash (2m) <br> **10:** Charge (15m) <br> **0:** Stomp (4m AoE Prone) |
| **Harassment** | **15:** Move (1d6+5m) <br> **10:** Smash (2m) <br> **5:** Hand Cannon (20m) <br> **0:** Tremor (Difficult Terrain) |
| **Violence** | **15:** Smash (2m) <br> **10:** Move (2m) <br> **5:** Smash (All in range) <br> **0:** Wobbly Stomp (Prone) |
| **Recharge** | **20:** Move Away <br> **15:** Stomp (Prone) <br> **10:** Move Away <br> **0:** Second Wind (Rest) |
| **Fury** | *Only used when at 1 Grit Die.* <br> **20:** Destroy Cover <br> **10:** Bite Everyone <br> **0:** Ragestomp |
