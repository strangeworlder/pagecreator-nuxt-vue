  Roleplaying games by Petri Leinonen. Indie tabletop RPGs like Cars & Family,
  Vuosisata, and more.
---

I'm Petri Leinonen, a TTRPG creator. I am active under three brands:
- **Gogam** &mdash; My "online indie games" brand. Stuff I make and these days publish for free, mostly on itch.io. 
- **Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam** &mdash; A mainly Finnish language publishing house that is also in charge of print versions of my indie games.
- **Gogam Entertainment** &mdash; A TTRPG entertainment company. I create actual plays under this banner.

## Gogam

Gogam is a full on indie powerhouse, churning out small, super-innovative games one after the other. 

### Fully completed and free products

- **Cars & Family** &mdash; this TTRPG puts you in the driver's seat as *Fast & Furious*-style international thieves using their incredible street racing skills for daring heists. Built on the elegantly simple Lasers & Feelings system, Cars & Family is an excellent lightweight game for explosive action fun. Available in both English and Finnish.

  - [roolipelikirjasto: Autot ja Perhe / Cars and Family](https://roolipelikirjasto.fi/series/stored/7)
- **Pros & Cons** drops you into a high-stakes heist movie like *Ocean's Eleven*, playing criminals pulling off an impossible job. It builds on the elegant simplicity of Lasers & Feelings, but instead of just a number, Pros & Cons defines your character with a single playing card (2-9, plus a suit for your strength). It also includes rules for genre staples - Twists and flashbacks.

- **Cyberpunk is Dead** &mdash; this FitD game flips the script on the cyberpunk genre: you're not rebellious heroes fighting the corps, you are the corps' disposable, underpaid hit squad, enforcing petty interests against often sympathetic targets. It masterfully subverts its Blades in the Dark inspiration by replacing playbooks with numbered, interchangeable "Operatives" and focuses the system on an unique 3d12 system where success often comes with overreaction and your life is a debt-inducing death spiral waiting to end. It's a bleakly fascinating critique of cyberpunk tropes through elegantly minimalist, pressure-cooker mechanics.

- **The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad** is a 2-player PvP card game that brilliantly simulates the core conflict of "arrogant superhero vs. a mere mortal" from such post-modern superhero stories such as of *The Boys*.

  - [itch.io: The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/the-necessary-eagle-vs-the-good-cad)
- **Bike on Fire** &mdash; a two-player, card based competitive RPG of tragic hobby obsession. Available in English and Finnish.
  - [Bike on Fire (en) / Palava pyörä (fi)](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/bike-on-fire) 
- **Vuosisata.** is a post-cataclysm RPG where history meets magic (1912-2012), uniquely powered entirely by a Tarot deck. Forget just rolling dice; succeed by creatively interpreting the meaning of cards played from your hand to narrate your character's success.

- **We can't stop here...** is a *Mörk Borg* compatible supplement about a wagon filled with magical herbs that would make any occult herbmaster wet their pants from excitement.

### Projects in various stage of completion

- **Night of the Thirteenth** &mdash; a tabletop RPG that flawlessly simulates a slasher movie, casting you as a most-likely-doomed main character whose only goal is to survive until sunrise. The game's brilliance lies in its unique "d13" (d10+d4) system, where even a success can give you consequences, causing you to make noise or lead the relentless killer right to you &mdash; pushing you one step closer to your third and final Strike.

  - [itch.io: Night of the Thirteenth](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/night-of-the-thirteenth)
- **Them Deeper Bones** &mdash; a post-post-apocalyptic retro adventure game / OSR style RPG where you explore a world generations after a magical cataclysm reshaped history. As part of a rare, officially sanctioned "Rediscovery Company", you venture beyond the borders of the known world to uncover lost treasures, forgotten lore, and the truth. Explicitly rejecting the colonialist Frontier Myth, Them Deeper Bones draws inspiration from Finnish folklore, presenting a wilderness full of ancient magic to be respected and ruins that whisper tales of your own ancestors.

- **+H** — a Finnish language modern-day science horror roleplaying game where players portray highly competent experts on a field team for the private biotech giant, New Horizons. The game focuses on the team's first true contact with the "shadow biosphere" &mdash; a newly active, non-carbon-based "second life" on Earth. Its excellent, mission-based system is built on *Powered by the Apocalypse* (*PbtA*) mechanics but is heavily modified, drawing innovations from story games, the Nordic immersion tradition, and a desire to modernize the investigative horror of *Call of Cthulhu*.

- **The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.** &mdash; a prototype combat system designed to shift the focus from a character sheet to player skill, tactical planning, and precise timing.

  - [itch.io: The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/the-pig-is-sus)
- **A Particular Group of Corvids** &mdash; casts you as hardboiled bird detectives in the free-thinking city of Roost, pushing back against the encroaching authoritarianism of The Sus (fascist pigs) by solving crimes and throwing punches. Inspired by gritty action-mysteries like RDJ's *Sherlock Holmes* or *Peaky Blinders* (with birds!), its elegance shines through a simple d20 core mechanic.
