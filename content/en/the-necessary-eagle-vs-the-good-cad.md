## What is **The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad**?

**The Necessary Eagle vs. The Good Cad** is a two-player, competitive TTRPG that channels the cynical, subversive energy of post-modern superhero stories like *The Boys*. It zeroes in on a sharp theme: the powerless fighting the super‑powerful in a media-obsessed world.

This isn't a game about saving the day; it's a game about PR, collateral damage, and the terrifying gap between a "hero" and a human. One player is **The Necessary Eagle**, a beacon of truth and justice who is secretly a dangerous sociopath. The other is **The Good Cad**, an ordinary person whose life was ruined by the Eagle's carelessness, now turned vigilante to burn it all down.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards. The Eagle uses them as superpowers to smash problems, generating "Bad Press" and hurting bystanders. The Cad scavenges those same cards from the wreckage to build weapons and schemes, turning the Hero's own power against them.

## The Asymmetrical War

This game is fundamentally unfair. The roles are completely different, with unique goals, resources, and mechanics.

### The Mighty Role: **The Necessary Eagle**

You are the golden god. You start with immense power: an **Ace** (invincibility), a **King**, and two **Queens**; and four superpowers tied to the card suits (like Spades for Strength or Diamonds for Blasts). Your job is to keep the world spinning and your image clean.

::alert{type="important" title="Eagle's Victory Condition"}
**Survivial.** You must survive until the deck runs out without letting the city collapse (leaving two conflicts unresolved) or being exposed by the Cad.
::

### The Underdog Role: **The Good Cad**

You are the dirt beneath their boots. You start with almost nothing: just a single **2** of your chosen suit (Resources, Weapons, Intel, or Determination) and a burning need for revenge. You can't fight the Eagle directly... yet.

::alert{type="important" title="Cad's Victory Condition"}
**Exposure.** You must win **two Showdowns** against the Eagle to expose them as a monster and destroy their legacy.
::

## Playing as The Eagle: The Burden of Power

The Eagle's turn is a frantic attempt to put out fires while maintaining a perfect smile.

It begins by **Drawing** up to five cards and immediately **Revealing Conflicts**. You draw two cards face-up; these are the crises threatening the city. The **Value** sets the threat level (from a simple 2 Robbery to an Ace Super Villain), and the **Suit** determines the type (Political, Business, Criminal, or Ideological).

### Countering Conflicts

To solve a problem, you must play cards from your hand (your powers) until their total value exceeds the Conflict's value. But power has a price:

*   **Collateral Damage:** If you use a Face Card (J, Q, K, A) to solve a problem, you hurt someone. You describe the damage; the Cad describes exactly who the victim was to them.
*   **Public Perception:** If you match the Conflict's suit perfectly, you gain **Popular Support**. If you use the wrong colors (or fail to counter it at all), you generate **Bad Press**.

::alert{type="warning" title="The Lose Condition"}
If you end your turn with **two uncountered conflicts** still on the table, the city falls into chaos and you lose immediately.
::

## Playing as The Cad: The Path of Revenge

The Cad's turn is about picking through the rubble to build a weapon.

It starts with **Scavenging**. Look at the cards the Eagle played to solve conflicts (or the conflicts themselves, if they were resolved). You can take one into your hand if its value is low enough (Value <= Your Hand Card + 1). If it's too high power for you to handle yet, it goes into your **Support Pile** instead.

### plotting and Scheming

Once you have resources, you **Draw a Scheme** (a face-up card from the deck). This is your plan. To pull it off, you must play cards from your hand or Support Pile to match its value. Completing Schemes builds your hand and prepares you for the finale.

### The Showdown

When you are ready, you can trigger a **Showdown** to confront the Eagle directly.

1.  The Eagle draws up to three cards.
2.  You launch your attack by playing any number of cards from your hand.
3.  The Eagle must defend by matching your total value.
4.  **Aces** are emotional hits; the Eagle needs *two* cards to block a single Ace.

If the Eagle cannot beat your total, you win the Showdown. Win two of these, and the Eagle falls.

## Special Mechanics

### Bad Press
If the Eagle has been sloppy, you can use their **Bad Press** tokens against them. Spending one allows you to return a card you just played back to your hand, representing the public turning a blind eye to your actions because they hate the "hero" so much.

### Intervening
Even when it's not your turn, the Cad is watching. You can play cards to buff a Conflict (making it harder for the Eagle) or even help the Eagle solve it (making you look like a partner... for now). These cards then become available for you to scavenge immediately.
