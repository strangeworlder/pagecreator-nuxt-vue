## Introduction to the player of Cars & Family

**Cars & Family** throws you directly into the world of high-speed heists and chosen family. It is widely considered one of the most beloved and thematic adaptations of the *Lasers & Feelings* system. You play as a member of an elite crew of international thieves known for pulling off impossible jobs using their unparalleled driving skills. 

The crew's boss, **Von Petrol**, is out of commission, recovering in the hospital, leaving the rest of the "family" to complete the dangerous heist. The game encourages balancing explosive car chases with the introspective moments that define the crew's bond.

## How to Play

The game engine is a smart adaptation of John Harper's minimalist classic, **Lasers & Feelings**. 

Character creation is lightning fast: you pick a **Car Style**, a **Role** (like Elite Street Racer or Tech Genius), and most importantly, a single number between **2 and 5**. This number is the core of the system.

When you attempt something risky, you roll **one or more d6s**. You gain extra dice if you're an expert or if the stakes are personal.

*   **CARS (Roll Under):** For driving skill, solo stunts, or physicality.
*   **FAMILY (Roll Over):** For teamwork, social maneuvering, or calm precision.

### Interpreting Results

Count your total number of hits to determine the outcome.

| Hits | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3+** | **Critical Success!** You do it, plus the GM gives you an extra benefit. |
| **2** | **Success.** You do what you set out to accomplish. |
| **1** | **Mixed Success.** You do it, but there's a complication or cost. |
| **0** | **Failure.** Something goes wrong. |

## Special Mechanics

### Von's Insight

If *any* of your dice lands **exactly on your number**, you gain a moment of clarity, reflecting on past rides with your boss. 

*   **Ask a Question:** You can ask the GM a question about the situation, and they'll answer as Von Petrol would.
*   **Change Approach:** If your initial approach isn't working, you can reroll your dice pool with a different stat (swapping Cars for Family or vice-versa). On this reroll, your number itself counts as a hit (they do *not* generate further insights).

### NOS

Once per session, you can "hit the Nitro" to up the stakes. This gives you **one extra, automatic hit** on any roll.

::alert{type="warning" title="The Risk of NOS"}
After using NOS, you must roll a single d6. 
- If it **matches your number**, you're cool. 
- If it results in **any other number**, things **EXPLODE AROUND YOU** (literally or figuratively).

## Character Creation Summary

Players make five main choices to join the crew:

1.  **Car Style:** (e.g., Classic, High Tech, Supercar).
2.  **Role:** (e.g., Elite Street Racer, Tech Genius, Former Spy).
3.  **Your Number:** A number between 2 and 5 (High = Better at Cars, Low = Better at Family).
4.  **Name:** A cool street racing name.
5.  **Goal:** (e.g., Avenge Von, Retire after this one last heist).
