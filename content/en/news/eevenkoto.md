Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam has launched a new news section on its website to centralize company communications. This update aims to enhance project transparency and provide enthusiasts with up-to-date information on the progress of various publications. Previously, company news has been decentralized, and this new channel is a response to the demand for a clearer overview of the production landscape.

In conjunction with the launch of the news section, Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam is pleased to announce a significant and long-awaited step in the production of the Eevenkoto campaign setting. The primary production responsibility and publishing rights for the project have been transferred from Myrrysmiehet Oy to Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam. This change is part of a strategic development intended to provide the project with the full attention and resources it requires: Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam will henceforth be independently responsible for the development, layout, and publishing process of this exceptional setting.

Eevenkoto is a campaign setting created for the L&L role-playing game, and it has already garnered widespread interest due to its unique atmosphere. The setting combines traditional fantasy elements with a post-war Jazz Age aesthetic. The work is currently in its final stages of development. The transfer of production responsibility to Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam is seen as a major opportunity to streamline both the production and publishing processes, ensuring the coherence of the world’s vision and a level of technical polish that meets the project's high standards.

Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam’s business model will continue to focus on high-quality book production and strong partner-driven distribution. While the company does not operate its own webstore, products are distributed extensively through domestic retailers and international digital channels. The next major milestone is Ropecon in July 2026, where Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam’s titles will be prominently featured at a joint sales point with Myrrysmiehet. Future publication schedules, pre-orders, and new projects will be announced first and foremost on this news platform.
