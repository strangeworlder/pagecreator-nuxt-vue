## What is **A Particular Group of Corvids?**

Step into the rain-slicked streets of Roost in **"A Particular Group of Corvids,"** a mystery and action RPG by Petri Leinonen. The Roost is a commune of free thinkers, artists, and highly individualistic **Folk**, animals and birds living together in a scoundrel society.

You play as **Corvids**, the city's trusted watchdogs. In a world increasingly dominated by the authoritarian porcine regime known as **The Sus**, your job is to keep their influence out. You do this by solving crimes and punching bad guys before The Sus have a "good reason" to intervene with their watery magic and civil masks. The tone is a blend of sharp investigation and bare-knuckle action. Think Robert Downey Jr.'s *Sherlock Holmes* meets *Peaky Blinders*, but with birds.

## How to Play

The game uses an elegantly simple system built for narrative flexibility. When you attempt something risky or dramatic, you don't just roll a stat; you assemble a **dice pool** of d20s. You start with one, then add another for each advantage you can leverage: is this something you're skilled at? Does it align with your **Bird Type** or **Element**? Is the moment extraordinarily dramatic, or do you have a clear tactical advantage? Conversely, hindrance or disadvantage removes a die.

You roll the entire pool and keep only the single highest result.

*   **10 or higher** is a success.

| Roll | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **20** | **Critical Success** (Great outcome + bonus) |
| **15-19** | **Great Success** (No complications) |
| **10-14** | **Marginal Success** (Success with a complication) |
| **5-9** | **Marginal Failure** (Failure with minor consequences) |
| **2-4** | **Failure** (Failure with standard consequences) |
| **1** | **Spectacular Failure** (Failure with major consequences) |

If you roll poorly, you aren't out of luck. You can choose to pay a **Cost** such as taking a hit or losing gear to bump a failure up to a success. Alternatively, you can spend **Conviction**, a measure of your willpower, to reroll a die and fight for a better outcome.

::alert{type="warning" title="Rolling with Zero Dice"}
If things are truly dire and obstacles leave you with zero dice or fewer, you must roll **two d20s** and keep the **lowest** result.
::

## The Cost of Business

Managing your resources is just as important as rolling high. You must balance your drive to do good against your own animal nature and physical limits.

*   **Conviction** represents your willingness to fight. You start with **1** and can hold up to **3**. You spend it to reroll dice, and you earn it back by connecting with your community: sharing a drink, or witnessing the hardships of the people you protect.
*   **Feathers** measure the pull of your base instincts. Use your powers or take the easy way out too often, and you accumulate Feathers. To stay in control, you must roll a d20 *over* your current Feather count. Roll equal or lower, and you succumb to your bird nature (like a Magpie's greed) for the scene, after which your Feathers reset to half.
*   **Exhaustion** is the toll the job takes on your body. You gain it when you witness injustice, take a beating, or push yourself too hard. If you take a hit in a fight, you roll against your current Exhaustion; roll lower than your total, and you're taken out of the scene. You can clear a single point by enjoying hospitality or striking a blow against The Sus, but only solving a mystery clears your Exhaustion completely.

## Action and Investigation

Whether you are trading blows or hunting for clues, the game moves forward.

In **Combat**, enemies have "health clocks" that you tick down with successful attacks. One tick for a marginal success, up to four for a critical. But be careful; every hit you take adds to your Exhaustion, bringing you closer to collapse.

In **Investigation**, failure doesn't mean you find nothing. It means you find the clue, but it comes with a complication: you trip an alarm, offend a witness, or leave evidence behind. The story always progresses, even when things go wrong.

## Creating Your Corvid

To join the flock, follow these steps:

1.  **Choose your Bird Type**: This determines your role and your **Base Instinct** (the urge you fight against).
2.  **Pick an Element**: This defines your expertise and sets your starting stats.
3.  **Select Powers**: You get all Level 1 powers for your Bird Type, plus one Level 2 power of your choice.
4.  **Finalize**: Create a background and discuss with your table how you know each other.

### Bird Types

When you answered the calling, you took on the characteristics of one of the five breeds.

| Bird Type | Role | Base Instinct (The Urge) | Key Powers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crow** | The Muscle | **The Bravo:** Be the center of attention. | Might, Endure, Terrorize |
| **Jackdaw** | The Spy | **The Perfectionist:** Do it right or not at all. | Dazzle, Transform, Sight |
| **Magpie** | The Thief | **The Selfish:** Look out for number one. | Swiftness, Veil, Sight |
| **Raven** | The Leader | **The Tyrant:** Make others obey. | Dictate, Terrorize, Dazzle |
| **Rook** | The Arcanist | **The Follower:** Please everyone. | Bird Magic, Veil, Endure |

### Elements

While every Corvid is a capable investigator, your Element defines your specific expertise and starting stats.

| Element | Role | Area of Expertise | Starting Stats |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blood** | The Medic | Understanding bodies (alive/dead). | 2 Exh, 2 Conv, 0 Feather |
| **Breath** | The Voice | Getting answers from people. | 0 Exh, 1 Conv, 1 Feather |
| **Flame** | The Keen-Eyed | Finding physical clues. | 1 Exh, 2 Conv, 1 Feather |
| **Soul** | The Empath | Profiling perpetrators. | 0 Exh, 2 Conv, 2 Feather |
| **Stone** | The Font | Obscure facts and lore. | 1 Exh, 1 Conv, 0 Feather |

Once you have your bird, discuss with your table how you know each other, and prepare to defend the Roost.

## Bird Powers Reference

Each power can be used once per scene.

**Dazzle**
Those skilled in performance use *Shine* (1 Feather) to force all attention onto themselves. Masters can use *Glow* (2 Feathers) to subtly manipulate a target's opinion into something more favourable.

**Dictate**
Leaders command the room. A sharp *Bark* (1 Feather) issues a compelling one-word command, while *Suggestion* (2 Feathers) plants a nuanced and complex order in the target's mind.

**Endure**
True grit allows a bird to be *Tough as Nails* (1 Feather), rolling to stay standing when they should be knocked out. With *Bounce Back* (2 Feathers), they can recover from a knockdown instantly. A Critical Success even grants an immediate follow-up action.

**Might**
Raw power allows a *Mighty Strike* (1 Feather), adding an extra tick to any damage clock. The truly strong possess *Superavian Strength* (2 Feathers), letting them lift car-sized objects; using such an object as a weapon doubles damage output.

**Sight**
Investigators rely on *Superior Senses* (1 Feather) to tune a sense to supernatural heights. *Glimpse of the Beyond* (2 Feathers) allows them to tap into the essence of a person or place for deep insight, costing only 1 Feather if the information is irrelevant, but 2 if it's instantly useful.

**Swiftness**
Speed is life. *Flash* (1 Feather) lets you move instantly to a nearby spot and act again immediately (though you cannot chain another power). *Flurry* (2 Feathers) blurs reality, allowing you to perform two full actions in the time it takes to do one.

**Terrorize**
Fear is a weapon. *Startle* (1 Feather) shocks a target into stopping to reconsider their actions. *Terrible Presence* (2 Feathers) projects such dread that enemies must roll all actions with disadvantage.

**Transform**
Masters of disguise use *New Visage* (1 Feather) to assume the appearance of another. For the ultimate escape, *Flock* (2 Feathers) scatters your form into a literal flock of birds, covering a large area while becoming impossible to pin down.

**Veil**
Subtlety is key. *Faceless* (1 Feather) makes you unnoticeable (visible, but ignored). *Poof* (2 Feathers) takes it a step further, allowing you to vanish from plain sight entirely.

**Bird Magic**
Those in tune with the arcane can summon *Birdrich Energies* (1 Feather) for minor magical effects. Greater power demands risk: *Daemonic Servant* (2 Feathers) summons an unbound devilish helper, while *Overreach* (2 Feathers) attempts a major magical effect. However, if you roll equal to or under your Exhaustion or Feathers on a check die afterwards, you lose control of the magic.
