## Introduction for New Players
"Vuosisata" (Finnish for "Century") is a role‑playing game set in a world much like ours, reeling from a cataclysm that unleashed magic and "gifted ones" upon history. Designed by Petri Leinonen and based on an ambitious campaign spanning 1912–2012, the game places characters within significant historical events, armed with strange abilities and facing a 100‑year countdown to a prophesied end of the world. Its themes revolve around shaping destiny, the interplay of magic and history, and confronting impending doom. It is presented with an informal tone and released under a Creative Commons license. The design aims to empower players through narrative, foster creative problem‑solving inspired by the system itself, and manage high lethality without sacrificing pacing.

The game's engine discards dice in favor of a standard Tarot deck. Core actions are resolved through a unique conflict system. When a character attempts something significant and risky, the GM checks if logic or story progression dictates the outcome; if not, they secretly draw a Tarot card. The player then plays a card from their hand (hand size is determined by their Harmony stat, maximum of five cards) and attempts to succeed primarily by "fast‑talking"—explaining how the meaning and symbolism of their chosen card allow them to overcome the challenge. If this interpretation is accepted, they succeed unless a Catastrophe occurs: if the numeric value of the player's card matches the GM's card (Major Arcana halved), the worst possible outcome unfolds. A fallback method allows resolving conflicts numerically using player‑defined Traits, character Stats (which are otherwise descriptive), and the difference between card numbers.

Character depth comes from interpretive attributes and unique mechanics. Player‑defined Traits (which can be almost anything, from "British" to "Yogurt") signal desired game content. Each player eventually gains a unique Nature—a descriptor linked to a specific Tarot card that grants automatic, potent success whenever it appears in play. Players manage Harmony, affecting their narrative options (hand size), and Dissonance, a per‑session resource allowing them to bend or break reality's rules through magic or sheer willpower, though it always triggers a risky conflict check. Lethality is handled explicitly: the GM must announce when Mortal Danger is present, making failures and Catastrophes potentially deadly, but doomed characters get a "2 Second Breather" for a final heroic act or a costly chance to defy fate. "Vuosisata" promises a system where narrative control, interpretive skill, and dramatic consequences take center stage.

Here’s the breakdown:

## What is Vuosisata?

Vuosisata is a tabletop role‑playing game system designed by Petri Leinonen, derived from a specific campaign spanning an alternate history from 1912 to 2012. It posits a world much like ours that experienced a cataclysm, introducing magic and "gifted ones" capable of shaping destiny against the backdrop of a century counting down to the world's end. The system emphasizes player narrative input ("fast‑talking"), low entry complexity, and meaningful consequences, using a Tarot deck as its core resolution tool.

### What are the design goals?

The system was built with specific aims:

* **Player‑driven solutions:** Encourage players to narratively explain how their characters overcome challenges rather than relying on stats.
* **Low barrier to entry:** Keep the core mechanics quick to explain, introducing complexity contextually.
* **Meaningful randomness:** Use Tarot to create interesting outcomes, especially dramatic successes and failures (Catastrophes).
* **Managed lethality:** Allow for high stakes and character death while clearly warning players and avoiding arbitrary outcomes or pace‑killing setbacks.

### How is the game played? (participant roles)

Vuosisata defines three roles:

* **Game Master (GM):** Plays the world and non‑player characters (NPCs), presents situations, interprets rules and card draws, maintains pace, ensures fairness, and helps weave player actions into a cohesive story.
* **Player:** Controls a Player Character (PC), makes decisions for them, drives the action, and collaborates to build the story and characters.
* **Observer:** A non‑playing participant who might be present but doesn't control a main character or initiate conflicts. They might occasionally play minor NPCs or provide randomized details at the GM's request.

### How are characters defined? (attributes)

Characters have five core mechanical attributes:

1. **Stats:** Nine abstract scores (1–5 scale, 24 total points) grouped into Physical (Brutality, Precision, Persistence), Mental (Logic, Cunning, Stability), and Personality (Magnetism, Control, Coldness). These define what sort of person the character is and serve as role‑playing guides or calibration tools rather than being directly used in most conflict resolutions.
2. **Traits:** Player‑defined descriptors (1–5 scale) representing skills, jobs, backgrounds, resources, or defining features (e.g., "Hunter," "British," "Imperial Assassin Ninja," "Yogurt"). These are crucial for the primary conflict resolution method and signal player interests. Starting characters have Traits at 3, 2, and 1 points.
3. **Nature:** A single‑word descriptor (e.g., "Foolhardy," "Passionate") chosen after several sessions, representing a core personality aspect. It's tied to a specific Tarot card unique to that player in the campaign. When this card appears in play, the player gets a guaranteed, spectacular success. Even the GM chooses a Nature.
4. **Harmony:** A score (starting at 2, ranging up to 14) representing the player's narrative influence and system familiarity. It directly determines the number of Tarot cards held in hand (minimum 2, maximum 5). Harmony above 5 allows players to draw extra cards at the session start and select their hand of five, discarding or returning extras.
5. **Dissonance:** A per‑session resource (starting at 0, typically 3–5 for experienced characters) representing "magic" or the ability to break established rules and reality. Spending Dissonance allows players to attempt extraordinary feats or challenge GM rulings, always triggering a conflict with potentially severe consequences. It replenishes at the start of each session.

### How is conflict resolved? (the core mechanic)

Vuosisata uses a Tarot‑based conflict resolution system, focusing on narrative outcomes over step‑by‑step actions.

1. **Initiation:** A player or the GM describes an action or situation where success and failure both lead to meaningful story developments.
2. **GM filter:** The GM first considers:
    * Does in‑world/genre logic dictate the outcome (e.g., shooting a helpless person point‑blank succeeds)? If yes, it happens without a draw. Dissonance can challenge this.
    * Does only one outcome progress the story while the other causes stagnation? If yes, the progressing outcome happens without a draw.
    * If neither applies, proceed to conflict resolution.
3. **The draw:** The GM draws one Tarot card from the deck, keeping its face hidden from the player.
4. **Player choice:**
    * Choose to fail: The player can opt for a simple failure before playing a card.
    * Play a card (primary method): The player chooses a card from their hand and explains how its meaning, symbolism, or imagery relates to the action and leads to success ("fast‑talking"). If the GM accepts the explanation, the player succeeds (barring Catastrophe).
    * Play a card (numeric method — secondary): If no card fits narratively, the player can play a card numerically. They declare a relevant Stat + Trait combination and its total value. They calculate: (Stat + Trait value) + (Player card value − GM card value). This final number is compared against a GM‑set difficulty (e.g., 7–8 easy, 14–17 very hard). Success requires meeting or beating the difficulty.
5. **Check for Catastrophe:** Before determining success or failure, compare the numeric value of the player's card and the GM's card.
    * Major Arcana: Divide their number by two for this check, rounding in the way most likely to cause a match (e.g., Death XIII counts as 6 or 7). The Fool (0) and Magician (I) have special low values.
    * Match: If the values match, a Catastrophe occurs. This means the worst possible outcome happens—a dramatic twist for the worse, failure plus severe negative consequences.
6. **Resolution:**
    * If a Catastrophe occurred, narrate the disastrous outcome.
    * If no Catastrophe occurred and the player succeeded (via card meaning or numeric check), narrate the success. The GM might incorporate the GM's drawn card for flavor.
    * If no Catastrophe occurred and the player failed (chose to fail or failed the numeric check), narrate the failure.
7. **Replenish hand:** Discard the played card(s) (player's and GM's). The player draws cards from the deck until their hand size matches their Harmony (up to a maximum of five).

### What are the special mechanics?

* **Using Dissonance:** Costs one Dissonance point, initiates a conflict, must use card meaning (no numeric option), requires strong narrative justification tied to the character, and Catastrophes are potentially lethal. Failing the justification or lacking a suitable card might require permanently lowering Dissonance.
* **Nature activation:** When a player's (or GM's) Nature card appears, they get an automatic, critical success and narrative focus. The GM's Nature allows significant plot twists. Conflicting Natures can result in mutual Catastrophe.
* **Raising difficulty:** The GM can draw two or three cards instead of one for the player to beat (Catastrophe on any match). Group challenges involve one GM card against multiple players. Thematic challenges might widen the Catastrophe range (e.g., adjacent numbers also count). Complex tasks can use a sequence of hidden cards.
* **High Harmony card swapping:** Players with Harmony above five can discard and redraw cards during a session, up to (Harmony − 5) times total. Nature cards cannot be discarded.
* **Player vs. Player:** Uses a moderated system where both players play cards against the GM's draw, with the outcome interpreted by the GM based on card meanings and values.
* **Combat:** Generally resolved via logic, not conflict resolution, unless narratively significant (like a duel). If cards are used, it should resolve the entire fight, not single blows.
* **Mortal Danger and death:** The GM must clearly signal when lethal consequences are possible. Catastrophes in Mortal Danger are lethal. Failure might also be lethal. Dying characters get a "2 Second Breather" for a final action or a risky Dissonance attempt to survive.
* **Emergent rules:** The system encourages developing unique character‑specific rules based on story events (e.g., blessings, curses, unique powers).
