  Roleplaying games by Petri Leinonen. Indie tabletop RPGs like Cars & Family,
  Vuosisata, and more.

I'm Petri Leinonen, a TTRPG creator. I am active under three brands:
- **Gogam** &mdash; My "online indie games" brand. Stuff I make and these days publish for free, mostly on itch.io. 
- **Kustannusosakeyhtiö Gogam** &mdash; A mainly Finnish language publishing house that is also in charge of print versions of my indie games.
- **Gogam Entertainment** &mdash; A TTRPG entertainment company. I create actual plays under this banner.

## Gogam

Gogam is a full on indie powerhouse, churning out small, super-innovative games one after the other. 

### Fully completed products

- **Cars & Family** &mdash; this TTRPG puts you in the driver's seat as *Fast & Furious*-style international thieves using their incredible street racing skills for daring heists. Built on the elegantly simple Lasers & Feelings system, you define your character with a single number (2-5); roll under for high-octane "Cars" actions (stunts, solo driving) or over for crucial "Family" actions (teamwork, social bonds). It enhances the core L&F experience with a couple of key thematic twists: rolling your exact number grants insight from your injured boss Von Petrol, which allows you, if you want, to change your approach to reroll your dice when your priorities shift, and a once-per-session "NOS" boost adds an extra hit with the risk of things literally or figuratively exploding.

  - [itch.io: Cars & Family (en) / Autot ja Perhe (fi)](https://strangeworlder.itch.io/cars-and-family) Version 2.  
  - Old version on GDocs: [en](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hIsLmmoRwm8upOu6tc1Amvqlads-SSX2O33rEB9yGX4/edit?usp=sharing)/[fi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VP7Ga9dVXVrfYmtfmjXyV2gJXKoBRw7rkeALg7PkYfH0/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Pros & Cons** &mdash; drops you into a high-stakes heist movie like *Ocean's Eleven*, playing criminals pulling off an impossible job. It builds on the elegant simplicity of Lasers & Feelings, defining your character with a single playing card (2-9, plus a suit for your strength); you succeed at "Pro" actions (practical, efficient) by drawing a card lower than or equal to yours, and "Con" actions (creative, flashy) by drawing higher or equal. Its brilliance lies in ditching dice for cards: the suit of the drawn card determines the degree of success or complication, face cards trigger escalating narrative "Twists" about the Mark, Prize, or Crew, and a slick "Flashback" mechanic lets you retroactively set up success by re-attempting checks.

- **Cyberpunk is Dead** &mdash; this FitD game flips the script on the cyberpunk genre: you're not rebellious heroes fighting the corps, you are the corps' disposable, underpaid hit squad, enforcing petty interests against often sympathetic targets. It masterfully subverts its Blades in the Dark inspiration by replacing playbooks with numbered, interchangeable "Operatives" and focusing on a unique core mechanic: roll 3d12, dropping two dice based on your current alertness state (Relaxed, Prepared, Alert). Success often comes with "overreaction," escalating situations, while failure piles on Stress, Harm, and mandatory, debt-inducing Cyberware —pushing your character towards inevitable burnout or corporate repossession. It's a bleakly fascinating critique of cyberpunk tropes through elegantly minimalist, pressure-cooker mechanics.

### Projects in various stage of completion

- **Night of the Thirteenth** &mdash; a tabletop RPG that flawlessly simulates a slasher movie, casting you as a most-likely-doomed main character whose only goal is to survive until sunrise. It’s heavily influenced by classic horror films, setting the action in places like a deserted summer camp and rewarding you with "Genre Points" for playing into horror tropes. The game's brilliance lies in its unique "d13" (d10+d4) system, where the d4 "Fallout die" dictates the consequences of every action. Even a successful roll can have a 'Dire' (a 4) result, causing you to make noise or lead the relentless killer right to you &mdash pushing you one step closer to your third and final Strike.

- **Them Deeper Bones** &mdash; a post-post-apocalyptic fantasy RPG where you explore a world generations after a magical cataclysm reshaped history. As part of a rare, officially sanctioned "Rediscovery Company", you venture beyond the borders of the known world to uncover lost treasures, forgotten lore, and the truth behind the official history's "Lie". Explicitly rejecting the colonialist Frontier Myth, the game draws inspiration from Finnish folklore, presenting a wilderness full of ancient magic to be respected and ruins that whisper tales of your own ancestors. Its excellence shines through its discovery-focused XP system, the unique magical birthrights that shape your character, and smooth pacing managed by distinct Gameplay Frames, all driving a sense of wonder and adventurous historical investigation.

- **+H** — a Finnish language modern-day science horror roleplaying game where players portray highly competent experts on a field team for the private biotech giant, New Horizons. The game focuses on the team's first true contact with the "shadow biosphere" —a newly active, non-carbon-based "second life" on Earth. Its core themes involve encountering the unknown, group formation under pressure, and the specific horror competent people face when their skills are useless against a threat they couldn't prepare for. Its excellent, mission-based system is built on Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) mechanics but is heavily modified, drawing innovations from story games, the Nordic immersion tradition, and a desire to modernize the investigative horror of Call of Cthulhu.

- **The pig is sus. Eliminate the pig.** &mdash; a prototype combat system designed to shift the focus from a character sheet to player skill, tactical planning, and precise timing. Instead of the typical D&D-style "I attack" turn, you must skillfully manage a pool of 5 Action Dice each round, deciding whether to stack them for a powerful hit, split them between attacking and defending, or spend them to "Rush" your action up the 20-beat Timer. Success isn't just about rolling high; it's about anticipating the Pig's predictable Patterns  and strategically placing your actions on the Timer to interrupt it, creating a tense puzzle that directly rewards smart, collaborative planning.

- **A Particular Group of Corvids** &mdash; casts you as hardboiled bird detectives in the free-thinking city of Roost, pushing back against the encroaching authoritarianism of The Sus (fascist pigs) by solving crimes and throwing punches. Inspired by gritty action-mysteries like Sherlock meets Peaky Blinders (with birds!), its elegance shines through a simple core mechanic: roll a pool of d20s based on your corvid's skills, type, and situation, keeping the highest result against a target of 10+. The system's potential is revealed in player-driven choices—take narrative "Costs" to improve success, spend "Conviction" to reroll, and risk accumulating "Feathers" which might cause you to lose control to your base bird instincts in moments of stress.
