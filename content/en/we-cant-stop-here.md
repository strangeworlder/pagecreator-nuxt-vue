## Introduction for New Players
"We can't stop here..." is a third-party supplement for the doom-metal RPG Mörk Borg, throwing characters into a desperate journey alongside a sentient, decaying herb wagon pulled by dying oxen. The wagon itself is both burden and key: travel in Mörk Borg's shifting landscape is near impossible without it, but moving with it demands constant consumption of its dangerous, hallucinogenic contents. The supplement leans heavily into themes of substance abuse, addiction, body horror, and psychedelic weirdness, offering a unique, grimy road trip experience through the dying world. It also includes a short adventure, "...this is Bat Country," where characters hunt murderous bat-men cultists who draw power from the herbs.

The core mechanics revolve around the wagon's cargo and a unique travel system. Characters must consume the unlabeled herbal concoctions to gain bonuses needed for the daily group d10 Travel Roll, which determines progress across a journey measured in abstract 'legs' rather than distance. Partaking involves rolling on a table (d6, d8, or d12 depending on how often you've consumed ) to determine the herb's effect, which might grant travel bonuses, strange abilities, healing, potent visions, or poisonous results. Repeated use on the same day increases risk. However, skipping a day triggers withdrawal, requiring a Toughness test (DR 10 + doses consumed) to avoid infection and ability score loss. The wagon is watched over by a mocking, telepathic Skull and tied to the ancient bat-warlock Yrtlepakko, the herbs' creator.

This journey is steeped in altered perception. Certain herbs trigger rolls on a Visions table, potentially granting powerful insights or permanent changes if specific rare visions are received. Furthermore, each character makes a daily roll on the 'trip encounter table'. The twist? An encounter is only considered 'real' if two or more characters roll the same result; otherwise, it's dismissed as a personal hallucination (though potentially still dangerous). This constant uncertainty, combined with the pressure to keep consuming despite mounting risks, creates a uniquely desperate and surreal Mörk Borg experience.

## What is "We Can't Stop Here..."?

"We Can't Stop Here..." is an independent sourcebook for the *Mörk Borg* role-playing game. It is not a standalone game and requires the core *Mörk Borg* rules to play. The supplement introduces a central element: a decaying, sentient herb wagon filled with dangerous, hallucinogenic concoctions. Players find themselves traveling with this wagon, which resists moving unless its passengers consume its strange cargo. The content deals with themes of substance abuse, violence, and religious fanaticism.

### How Do the Mechanics Work?

The supplement introduces several new mechanics centered around the herb wagon:

1.  **Consuming Herbs:**
    * Players consume herbs by taking a dose from one of the many unlabeled clay jars in the wagon.
    * The first time a character consumes an herb, they roll a d6 on the effects table. This escalates to a d8 for the second time ever, and a d12 for any subsequent times.
    * Consuming multiple jars in the same day applies a cumulative +1 bonus to the effects roll for each dose after the first.
    * Effects range from sedatives and relaxants to powerful stimulants and dangerous hallucinogens, often providing bonuses to the day's travel roll but also carrying risks like ability penalties, visions, or straight-up poisoning. Some results might require a Toughness test to avoid negative side effects.
    * Players trying to find a specific herb they've had before roll normally, but get one re-roll if the result isn't the desired herb. Occult Herbmasters get one re-roll per day regardless.

2.  **Travel:**
    * Journeys are measured in "legs," set by the GM based on distance (e.g., 3 for short, 15 for long).
    * Each day, the group makes a single d10 Travel Roll to see how much progress they make.
    * Each character contributes the *highest* travel bonus they received from consuming herbs that day to this group roll.
    * Results determine progress: 0 or less loses the wagon; 1-2 loses a leg; 3-8 makes no progress; 9-13 progresses one leg; 14-17 progresses two legs; 18+ progresses three legs.

3.  **Withdrawal ("The Morning After"):**
    * If a character consumed herbs previously but does not consume more the next day, they face withdrawal effects by midday.
    * They must make a Toughness test (DR 10 + total number of portions consumed ever).
    * Failure results in losing d6 Toughness and becoming infected. Success still imposes a -1 penalty on the day's travel roll.
    * The infection and Toughness loss are cured by consuming more herbs or heal slowly over time.

4.  **Visions:**
    * Certain herbs induce "paralyzing visions".
    * Players roll on three d12 tables to determine the vision's Style, Theme, and Target (e.g., "Pure Agony of Your Soul," "True End of The World").
    * Specific combinations can have powerful effects, like instant character vanishing, permanent Presence increase, or gaining Toughness and Presence.
    * The GM secretly rolls a d8; on a 6+, the vision contains a crucial truth, though all visions feel important.

5.  **Trip Encounters:**
    * While traveling, each character makes a daily roll (usually d4, but some herbs modify this) on the Trip Encounter table.
    * Encounters range from strange sky shapes and other travelers to swarms of animals, hermits, parents, sky morays, or even the wagon's Skull or Yrzaakko herself.
    * Crucially: An encounter is only real if two or more characters roll the same result. Otherwise, it's a hallucination that fades or can be dismissed with a DR10 Presence test. Hallucinations can still potentially harm the character.

6.  **The Skull:**
    * A skull sits atop the wagon, watching the characters.
    * If confronted, it's hostile, mocking, and uses mental attacks. Anyone attacking it must pass a DR15 Presence test or be magically compelled to consume an herb from the wagon.

7.  **Yrtlepakko, The Bat of the Herbs:**
    * An ancient, otherworldly bat-like warlock who created the herbs and the wagon. She judges those who use her "children" and may teach secrets to devoted consumers. She can appear as a Trip Encounter or be summoned. In combat, she attacks twice with her mouths and can exhale a cloud of herbal dust that forces a roll on the herb effects table.

### What is "...This is Bat Country"?

"...This is Bat Country" is an introductory adventure included within the "We Can't Stop Here..." supplement. It is designed to lead characters to discover the herb wagon.

**The Premise:**
The adventure begins after the player characters' friends have been murdered by mysterious "bat-men". Swearing revenge, the characters follow clues left behind.

**The Investigation:**
Players discover clues pointing towards the bat-men's nature and location by rolling d8s twice each. Clues might relate to moss, light sensitivity, religious behavior, smells, or visions. Rolling the same number twice means the character hears the Skull from the wagon guiding them towards a "treasure".

**The Antagonists:**
The bat-men are a small (8 members) religious sect fanatically following visions their leader, MSK, receives from Yrtlepakko by consuming herbs from the wagon. Their murders were a result of interpreting these visions.

**The Location: Cave of the Bat-Men:**
The adventure primarily takes place in the bat-men's lair, an old temple carved into a cliffside. Key areas include:

* **A. The Herb Wagon:** The entrance cave where the wagon is kept. Usually unguarded. Contains two aggressive Oxen. The entrance (A1) is a flimsy double door that might fall noisily.
* **B. The Guard Caves:** Corridors with a chance (50% for one, 10% for two) of containing Bat-Man Guards. Guards may hide in alcoves (B1, B2) to ambush intruders. Bat-Man Guard stats: HP 9, Morale 8, -d4 Armor, d6 Spike.
* **C. The Living Quarters:** A cavern with bunks for the 8 bat-men. Usually (80%) contains d4 bat-men, likely including some of the three volatile Younglings. Bat-Man Youngling stats: HP 6, Morale 6, No Armor, d6 Sword. Searching yields coins, a scroll, and instructions for the door C1. The door (C1) is trapped, requiring dials to be aligned to open safely.
* **D. The Compost:** A damp cave where herbs are grown using corpses as fertilizer. Always contains d4 regular Bat-Men tending the garden. They consider it a holy place and aren't instantly hostile. Bat-Man stats: HP 7, Morale 7, No Armor, d6 Axe. Searching the compost yields silver, items, and possibly the corpse of someone the PCs knew. A collapsed corridor (D1) leads nowhere useful.
* **E. The Temple of Yrtlepakko:** An ancient marble temple upstairs. Likely (90%) contains MSK, the leader, possibly (75%) with another bat-man. All bat-men and Yrtlepakko herself are present on the midnight of a full moon. MSK, Bat-Man Priest stats: HP 12, Morale -, -d2 Robes, d4 Dagger, Special bat swarm attack. MSK is fanatical, carries valuable jewelry, and has 2 sacred scrolls. The altar (E1) may have a giant bat tied to it, which can be freed or sacrificed (potentially summoning Yrtlepakko).
