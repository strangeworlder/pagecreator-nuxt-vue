Introduction for New Players
"The Pig Is Sus. Eliminate the Pig." is a prototype for a tactical RPG combat system, explicitly designed to explore mechanics that reward player skill over a character's raw stats . It moves away from the traditional D&D model of static turns and initiative orders. Instead, it presents combat as a dynamic puzzle that challenges players in three key areas: resource allocation, timing, and strategic anticipation. The game's premise—reanimated corpses fighting a monstrous "Pig"—is a focused scenario built to test these specific, skill-forward concepts.

The system's brilliance lies in its unique Action Dice economy . At the start of a round, each player gets 5 Action Dice. This is where player skill immediately comes into play. You must decide how to allocate these dice: do you put all 5 into a single, high-probability Attack? Or do you allocate 2 to an Attack, 1 to Defend, and 2 to Rush? Rushing is critical, as all actions are resolved on The Timer, a 20-beat countdown . This mechanic replaces a simple initiative roll, forcing players to skillfully decide when their action occurs, weighing the need for speed against the desire for power.

This system is further built to reward planning by making the enemy's actions transparent. The Pig operates on a fixed Pattern of Actions each round, acting on specific, pre-announced Beats of The Timer . This transforms the fight from a reactive dice-rolling contest into a proactive, tactical challenge. Player skill is expressed through anticipating these known moves and timing your own actions to interrupt or avoid them. This all pays off in the Threat Dice mechanic : failed attacks build up Threat on the target, making them harder to damage, while a successful hit clears all Threat . This creates a tense loop where every decision matters, and a well-planned, skillfully-timed strike is infinitely more valuable than a lucky roll.
