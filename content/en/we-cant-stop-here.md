## What is **"We can't stop here..."**?

The herb wagon is old, creaky and smells of compost. The ox move steady, but are inches from their last day to come. The watcher on top never falters. And the cargo is **precious indeed**.

**We Can't Stop Here...** is a supplement about traveling with this decaying wagon, filled to the brim with preserved herbs and fungi: pastes, powders and ointments of varying sorts. All of them stored in moist clay jars or worse. On top of the strange wagon sits a lone skull in a reliquary keeping watch, turning to face you as you go about your business, but other than that, doing nothing. A sweet smell of compost lingers around the cart.

Traveling across the land is dangerous. Paths between places shift. Distances and routes warp. It’s hard enough if you don’t have the herb wagon with you. It’s near impossible if you travel besides it as it does not want to move. But if you accept it, you’ll get where you’re going.

You just need to consume.

## How Does it Work?

The rules focus on the **risk and reward** of addiction. The wagon is the only way to travel safely through the dying world, but it demands a toll.

### The Consumption Loop
The wagon is overflowing with clay jars filled with various unlabeled concoctions. To make the wagon move, you must partake.

*   **Escalating Risk:** The first time you eat from a jar, your instincts guide you (roll **d6**). The second time, you are less careful (roll **d8**). From then on, the wagon's lure takes over (roll **d12**).
*   **Trip Effects:** Effects range from powerful stimulants like **Von Root** (+1 Strength) to necromantic psychoactives like **Knuckle Rot**, which makes everyone you see appear as a rotting corpse.
*   **The Morning After:** Unlike other games where you heal overnight, here the next day brings "misery and woe." If you stop consuming, you face withdrawal, infection, and ability loss.

### Shared Hallucinations
The most unique mechanic in the book is the **Trip Encounter Table**.

Every day, each player rolls to see what they encounter on the road. It might be a **Pink Sky Moray**, a **Swarm of Bats**, or even **Your Parents**.

The twist? **It's only real if two people see it.**

If two players roll the same result, the encounter physically manifests and must be fought or dealt with. If only one player rolls it, it's a hallucination, but one that can still kill them if they don't steel their mind against it.

### The Watcher
On top of the wagon sits **The Skull**. It watches. It mocks. It is the remnant of an ancient herbmaster, and it serves as both a guide and a tormentor. It will occasionally speak into the minds of those who are truly lost in the sauce, guiding them toward "treasure" that may or may not exist.

## What is "...this is BAT country"?

Included in the supplement is a complete introductory adventure.

*They flew in at night. Through the window that was open. Killed your friends right in front of you. And then they flew out, back to the night. Men with wings of bats and mouths upon mouths.*

**"...this is BAT country"** is a revenge story that leads the players to the **Cave of the Bat-Men**, a small religious sect fanatically following their leader **MSK** and the ancient bat-warlock **Yrtlepakko**.

It features:
*   A procedural investigation phase where clues are found in the hallucinations.
*   A dungeon crawl through a temple carved into a cliffside, filled with traps, compost gardens, and volatile "Younglings."
*   Stats for unique monsters, including the **Bat-Men**, the fanatical **Priest**, and the ancient **Bat of the Herbs** herself.
