## Introduction for New Players
"Cyberpunk is Dead" offers a starkly different take on the cyberpunk genre. Forget being neon-drenched rebels fighting for freedom; here, you embody the grim reality of corporate power as members of an "underpaid corporate interests upkeep operations group" — a euphemism for a faceless corporate hit squad. Set in an ultra-market-driven future, the game deliberately subverts genre expectations. Your missions aren't about taking down monolithic corporations; they're about enforcing their mundane and often cruel will — repo-ing cybernetics from defaulters, destroying unlicensed farm products, or breaking up groups trying to create open-source alternatives to corporate tech. The game compels you to play the antagonists, offering a critical perspective on the dehumanizing core of the cyberpunk world.

Mechanically, "Cyberpunk is Dead" takes the chassis of Blades in the Dark and radically modifies it towards minimalism and disposability. Character individuality is suppressed; instead of distinct playbooks, you are simply designated Operatives with numbers, defined primarily by a chosen Approach (Tech, Brute force, Calculating) and a single piece of starting Cyberware. The core resolution mechanic is innovative: you roll 3d12, then discard two dice based on your character's current STATE (0: Relaxed drops highest two, 1: Prepared drops highest and lowest, 2: Alert drops lowest two), leaving a single die result. Results determine Failure, Success, or Success with Overreaction, the latter often escalating the situation and increasing Stress, reflecting the messy reality of corporate wetwork. Resources like Equipment and Cyberware can modify rolls or turn failures into successes, but often at the cost of Stress and mission Expense.

What makes "Cyberpunk is Dead" compelling is its tight focus on the cycle of corporate exploitation. Stress accumulates rapidly through overreactions and failures. Between missions, high Stress forces a choice: gain Trauma or install more Cyberware. Suffering Harm or being taken Down/Out also results in mandatory Cyberware installation. This creates a relentless downward spiral: operatives become laden with corporate-owned cybernetics, racking up debt (tracked abstractly via failed d12 rolls between missions based on cyberware count) and Trauma until they inevitably break—either removed for breach of contract (repossession of body parts implied) or burning out from psychological strain. Even the team unit is precarious, risking dissolution if deemed too "profitable" (expensive) by the corporation. It's a game that uses its mechanics to deliver a potent, uncomfortable message about the genre and the systems it portrays.

## What is *Cyberpunk is Dead*?

*Cyberpunk is Dead* is a rules-light, story-focused tabletop role-playing game that uses the *Blades in the Dark* system as its foundation. However, it completely subverts the themes of the cyberpunk genre.

Instead of playing as rebellious "edgerunners" or "street samurai" fighting the system, you play as an "underpaid corporate interests upkeep operations group." You are a faceless, expendable corporate hit squad, and your job is to enforce the company's will.

The game's mechanics are expertly designed to make you feel like a disposable asset, not a hero. You aren't fighting the corps; you are the boot on the neck of anyone who tries.

### How Does the Core Mechanic Work?

The game's central mechanic is a 3d12 dice roll that is filtered through your character's mental "STATE."

When you perform a risky action, you roll 3d12. Your current STATE determines which two dice you must *drop* before seeing your result:

* **RELAXED (0):** You are off-guard. Drop the two *highest* dice.
* **PREPARED (1):** You are focused. Drop the *highest and lowest* dice.
* **ALERT (2):** You are "on edge." Drop the two *lowest* dice.

The single die that remains is your result.
* **5 or less:** Failure.
* **6-7:** Success.
* **8 or more:** Success with Overreaction.

This "Success with Overreaction" mechanic is key. It means you succeed, but in a way that causes collateral damage, wastes company resources, or attracts media attention, which in turn escalates the **Situation** (Clear, Standard, SNAFU) and adds to your **Stress**.

### What Makes *Cyberpunk is Dead* Different? The Subversion

The game's true genius lies in its subversion of classic cyberpunk tropes, using its "Between Missions" (downtime) mechanics to reinforce its bleak, anti-power-fantasy themes.

#### Cyberware Isn't a Choice, It's a Consequence

In most cyberpunk games, getting cyberware is an "upgrade" you choose. In *Cyberpunk is Dead*, it is a *consequence of failure*.

When your character takes HARM or is taken DWN/OUT during a mission, the *only* way to "heal" between missions is for the corporation to install a new piece of CYBERWARE. It's not an upgrade; it's a repair. You are company property, and the company is just fixing its broken asset by putting you further in its debt.

Similarly, if you have too much **Stress**, your only options are to risk gaining permanent **Trauma** or to "voluntarily" take another piece of CYBERWARE to cope.

#### The More "Cyber" You Are, the Less "Punk" You Become

The game's most powerful subversion is its "Breach of Contract" mechanic. The corporation doesn't give you cyberware for free; you're on a payment plan.

Between missions, you must roll a d12. If the result is *less than* the total number of CYBERWARE you have, your character is **Removed from the Team for breach of contract**. You have defaulted on your body, and the corporation sends another team—possibly your former squadmates—to repossess its property.

This brilliantly inverts the genre: the more "upgraded" you become, the more of a financial liability you are, and the more likely the corporation is to foreclose on your life.

#### There Is No "Winning"

The game offers two ways to "lose" your character, both reinforcing the theme of burnout and disposability.

1.  **Burnout:** If you accumulate too much **Trauma** from stressful missions, you must roll. If you fail, your character simply **Removes yourself from the Team** and stops showing up. They are burned out and broken.
2.  **Redundancy:** The team has a **Profit** track. If you are too successful and this track reaches its maximum, the team must roll. If they "succeed," the corporation decides the team is "too expensive" and "reorganizes," firing the *entire* squad to outsource the job to a cheaper service provider.

### What is the Goal of the Game?

The goal is not to save the world or topple the corporations. The goal is to see how long you can last.

The person running the game (the "Corporation") is explicitly instructed to make mission targets—like people pirating life-saving drugs or operatives who defaulted on their cybernetic eye payments—"likeable" and to "portray the actions of the team in a bad light."

You are the bad guys. Your job is to repossess a stolen pacemaker, destroy a farm's "pirated" crops, or "neutralize" counterculture activists. *Cyberpunk is Dead* is a powerful, satirical look at the genre, using its mechanics to force players to confront the true meaning of being corporate property.
